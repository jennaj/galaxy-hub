# Galaxy Community Hub [![Build Status](https://jenkins.galaxyproject.org/buildStatus/icon?job=galaxy-hub)](https://jenkins.galaxyproject.org/job/galaxy-hub/)

Source for the [Galaxy Hub Website
(galaxyproject.org)](https://galaxyproject.org/).  The Galaxy Hub is the
community and documentation hub for the Galaxy Project.  It is maintained by
the community through this GitHub repository.  It is a static website built
using the [metalsmith](http://www.metalsmith.io/) static site generator.

Interested in contributing?  To get started all you need is a GitHub account

## About the Galaxy Project.

We could describe it here, but really, see the web site that is generated from
this repository: [galaxyproject.org](https://galaxyproject.org).  That will
save a lot of typing.

## Should I access the Galaxy Hub website through GitHub or  galaxyproject.org?

The only reason to navigate through the GitHub is if you are making updates to
the web site (see [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md)).  If you just want to
read and explore the web site, then you should absolutely do that through
[galaxyproject.org](https://galaxyproject.org).  The site is not quite rendered
correctly in the GitHub web site: it is missing some magic metalsmith,
Bootstrap, and Font Awesome bits that are added when the site is generated.

## Finally,

Thanks for using Galaxy!
