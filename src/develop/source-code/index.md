title: Source code of Galaxy
---

Galaxy is an open source software under [AFL 3.0](/src/admin/license/index.md) license.

The source code is publicly available and [hosted at GitHub](https://github.com/galaxyproject/galaxy). If you need help getting started, the [GitHub Git tutorial](https://try.github.io/) is a good place.


## GitHub

[https://github.com/galaxyproject/galaxy/](https://github.com/galaxyproject/galaxy/) is the canonical repository.

If you have created piece of code for Galaxy that you would like to share with the community, please follow the instructions contained in https://github.com/galaxyproject/galaxy/blob/dev/CONTRIBUTING.md.

### branches

The following branches exist:

* `release_YY.MM` - contains commits of the `YY.MM` stable release (recommended branches to run in production)
* `dev` - primary development, new features, largely untested, should not be run in production
* `master` - should be updated to the most recent stable release (but often is lacking in this matter)


You can get the current "in-development" code (where in-development code is on the `dev` branch) with:

```sh
% git clone https://github.com/galaxyproject/galaxy.git
% cd galaxy
```

And receive updates

```sh
% git checkout dev
% git pull
```
## Mercurial and BitBucket

Before the switch to GitHub in 2015 the Galaxy source code has been hosted on BitBucket.

### How to migrate a Galaxy instance from Mercurial Bitbucket to Git GitHub

1. Backup everything.
1. Find what branch and commit is your Mercurial Galaxy at:
  ```#! highlight sh
  $ hg log -b $(hg branch)
  ```

1. `git clone https://github.com/galaxyproject/galaxy` in a temporary directory.
1. Find the corresponding commit in the cloned Git repository on the corresponding branch (Bitbucket default->GitHub dev; Bitbucket stable->GitHub master).
1. Checkout the GitHub repository at the commit you found in the previous step.
1. Backup your `.hg/` folder.
1. Replace your `.hg/` folder with the `.git/` folder from the new checkout.
1. Your Galaxy should be switched to Git. Unless you have local changes, `git status` should show none.
1. You can now update to the latest Git revision:
  ```#! highlight sh
  $ git pull
  ```

### How to find hg commit in git history

For commits made prior to the switch to git, you can find the former HG commit IDs via git notes. Assuming you have set the [canonical Galaxy GitHub repository](https://github.com/galaxyproject/galaxy/) as the remote `upstream`, it is done like so (if you cloned directly from the canonical source rather than your own GitHub fork, the remote would be `origin`):

```sh
% git fetch upstream refs/notes/hg2git:refs/notes/hg2git`
% git log --show-notes=hg2git [-1 git-commit-hash]
```


e.g.:

```sh
% cd galaxy.git
% git log --show-notes=hg2git -1 579edf01b1416d52ac99f8675b6f86d677d6ee0e
