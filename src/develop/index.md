title: Galaxy Development
---

This page collects resources that are helpful to development of various aspects of the Galaxy software. It is aimed to provide help to all of the numerous Galaxy's [contributors](https://www.openhub.net/p/galaxybx). We salute you!

If your interest lies in the development of tools for Galaxy please see the [Adding custom tools tutorial](/src/admin/tools/add-tool-tutorial/index.md).

## Source code

* [Source Code](/src/develop/source-code/index.md) - Where is the source code and how to contribute.

## Documentation

We use [Sphinx](http://sphinx-doc.org/) to generate documentation on classes and methods (and much more) in the code base.  It also includes [Python docstrings](http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0257/) from the code.
Sphinx uses [reStructured Text (RST)](http://sphinx-doc.org/rest.html) with some [Sphinx-specific additions](http://sphinx-doc.org/markup/index.html) for markup.
You can generate your own copy of the documentation. You might want to do this if you have made local modifications/extensions to the code, or if you are adding documentation that will be merged back.
Contribution of documentation is very welcome. To generate the documentation simply execute `make docs` from Galaxy's root directory. The generated documentation will be in `doc/build/html/` and can be viewed in a web browser.
