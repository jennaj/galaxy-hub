Galaxy is an open, web-based platform for data intensive biomedical research. Galaxy's goal is to be *accessible*, *reproducible*, and *transparent*. 

* **Accessible:** Users without programming experience can easily specify parameters and run tools and workflows.
* **Reproducible:** Galaxy captures information so that any user can repeat and understand a complete computational analysis.
* **Transparent:** Users share and publish analyses via the web and create Pages, interactive, web-based documents that describe a complete analysis.

In addition to using the [public Galaxy server](http://usegalaxy.org), you can also install your [own instance of Galaxy](/src/admin/get-galaxy/index.md), or create an [instance of Galaxy on the cloud using CloudMan](/src/cloudman/index.md) and explore all [Cloud](/src/cloud/index.md) resources.  Another option is to use one of the ever-increasing number of [Public Galaxy Servers](/src/use/index.md) hosted by other organizations.


The [Galaxy Team](http://wiki.galaxyproject.org/GalaxyTeam) is a part of the [Center for Comparative Genomics and Bioinformatics](http://www.bx.psu.edu/) at [Penn State](http://www.psu.edu/), and the [Department of Biology](http://www.bio.jhu.edu/) at [Johns Hopkinis University](http://www.jhu.edu/). 

[Galaxy](http://usegalaxy.org ) is supported in part by [NSF](http://www.nsf.gov/), [NHGRI](http://www.genome.gov/), the [Huck Institutes of the Life Sciences](http://www.huck.psu.edu/), and [The Institute for CyberScience at Penn State](http://www.ics.psu.edu/), and [Johns Hopkins University](http://www.jhu.edu/).

The [public Main instance](/src/main/index.md) of Galaxy at [http://usegalaxy.org](http://usegalaxy.org) utilizes infrastructure generously provided by the [iPlant Collaborative](http://www.iplantcollaborative.org/) at the [Texas Advanced Computing Center](https://www.tacc.utexas.edu/), with support from the [National Science Foundation](http://www.nsf.gov/).


Thank you for your for *Using Galaxy!* We hope these resources help to further *everyone's* research goals.
