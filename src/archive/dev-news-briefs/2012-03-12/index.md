# Important Changes to Tool Organization

## The Emboss tools and Emboss datatypes will be eliminated from the Galaxy distribution in the NEXT release (not this one).  Other tools currently in the Galaxy distribution will be eliminated in following releases.  Those hosting local Galaxy instances should read this revised "Migrating tools" section of the Galaxy tool shed wiki to understand how this process will work:

## Migrating tools from the Galaxy distribution to the Galaxy Main tool shed

In 2012, the Galaxy development team will begin the process of **migrating the tools that are currently available in the Galaxy distribution to the [Galaxy Main tool shed](http://toolshed.g2.bx.psu.edu/)**.  This will enable those that host local Galaxy instances much more flexibility in choosing to provide only those specific tools in which their users are interested.

## XML configuration files used to populate your Galaxy tool panel

In the past, the file named by your "tool_config_file" configuration setting in your "universe_wsgi.ini" file was the only file used to populate your Galaxy tool panel.  The default name for this file is **tool_conf.xml**.  Since this was the only file involved in populating your Galaxy tool panel, it defined the items (tools, workflows, sections and labels) that would be displayed and the way in which they would be arranged. [Read more...](/src/galaxy-tool-panel/index.md#xml-configuration-files-used-to-populate-your-galaxy-tool-panel)

## Managing the layout of your Galaxy tool panel

The 3 or more files described in the previous section ("tool_conf.xml", one or more "shed_tool_conf.xml files", and "migrated_tools_conf.xml") are all used to load tool panel items (tools, sections, labels and workflows).  A new file named **integrated_tool_panel.xml** has been introduced to define the arrangement for displaying these loaded items in your Galaxy tool panel. [Read more...](/src/galaxy-tool-panel/index.md#managing-the-layout-of-your-galaxy-tool-panel)

## Galaxy Tool Versions

When included in the Galaxy distribution, tools are defined by "id" and "version", among other attributes.  For example, the filter tool has id="Filter1" and version="1.1.0".  When installed from a tool shed, the tool's id becomes its "guid" attribute from the tool shed.  If it is migrated from the Galaxy distribution to the tool shed, the filter tool will have the guid: "toolshed.g2.bx.psu.edu/repos/devteam/filter/Filter1/1.1.0".  To provide backward compatibility for Galaxy workflows and the rerun button in a Galaxy history item, a mapping between the tool's old id and version and its new id (guid) is provided by building a chain of relationships between tool versions.  This happens automatically for every tool that is loaded into your Galaxy instance. [Read more...](/src/galaxy-tool-version-lineage/index.md)

## New tool shed related features in Galaxy

1) When an installed tool shed repository that contains tools is being reinstalled, allow the admin to select a different section in the tool panel (than was originally selected when the repository was last installed) to contain the included tools.

2) Load proprietary datatypes from installed tool shed repositories before the datatypes in the Galaxy distribution are loaded. We do this because the distribution includes some extremely generic sniffers (e.g., text,xml) which will catch pretty much anything, making it impossible for proprietary sniffers to be used. Proprietary datatypes contained in installed repositories are loaded in order of oldest installation first, followed by next oldest installation, etc. In handling conflicts (2 different datatypes that use the same extension), the rule is that a datatype currently being loaded will always override a conflicting datatypes that was previously loaded. Since datatypes defined in Galaxy's datatypes_conf.xml file are loaded last, they will override conflicts that may occur if tool shed repositories that contained datatypes were installed. If a new tool shed repository is being installed into a running Galaxy instance, conflicting datatypes will not override those currently in the datatypes registry.

## Tool shed related fixes in Galaxy

1) Fix for rendering the page that allows you to select a tool section in which to include tools contained in a repository installed from a tool shed where the tool panel includes tool section labels.
2) Load empty tool sections into the in-memory tool_panel dictionary, just don't display them in the tool panel.

# New & Updated Tools

*Many tools have been recently upgraded. Please review* [Admin/Config/Tool Dependencies](/src/admin/config/tool-dependencies/index.md) *for these and other recently updated Tool Dependencies. Please see * [Galaxy's Main Tool Shed](http://toolshed.g2.bx.psu.edu/) * for additional new tools.*
* **RNA-Seq Tools**
  * Added **[CuffMerge](http://cufflinks.cbcb.umd.edu/)** version 1.0.0
    * Requires helper script: **gtf_to_sam** version 1.3.0
  * Updates for **[Cufflinks/compare/merge/diff tools](http://cufflinks.cbcb.umd.edu/)**
    * Modified default parameter values on tool form
    * Improved error message when bias correction/sequence data cannot be used
* Updates for **[TopHat](http://tophat.cbcb.umd.edu/)**
  * Remove maximum value for [TopHat](http://tophat.cbcb.umd.edu/) parameter `initial_read_mismatches`
* Added **[RViewer](http://rviewer.lbl.gov/rviewer/)** external display application
* Updated **[IGV](http://www.broadinstitute.org/igv/)** external display application, so that displays using vcf_bgzip will now maintain vcf headers

# Galaxy Track Browser (GTB)

**[Trackster](/src/learn/visualization/index.md)**

# Workflows

* Properly select only Input Dataset steps for multi-input configuration
* Update and clarify label selector
* Multiple run workflows now copy input datasets to newly created histories when used.
* Add a more useful error message when input keys don't map upon executing a workflow instead of tossing to Server Error:
  * *example,* This happens in situations where outputs are conditionally filtered yet still used in the workflows. (See SICER's significant_islands_summary_output_file)
* Add the ability to remove workflows that have been shared with you
* When workflow output is placed into separate new histories, naming is now based on the varied input dataset instead of the execution number:
  * *example,* "<workflowname> on <varied_input>".
* Add the ability to view your own workflows in plain display mode as if you had shared it
* Additional rename options available to Rename Datasets action (thanks to Dave Walton)

```
        Syntax:
            #{inputs_file_variable | option 1 | option n}
            where:
                 input_file_variable = is the name of a module input variable
                 |  = the delimiter for added options. Optional if no options.
                 options = basename, upper, lower
                 basename = keep all of the file name except the extension
                            (everything before the final ".")
                 upper = force the file name to upper case
                 lower = force the file name to lower case
        Example:
            #{input1 | basename | upper}
```


# User Interface (UI)

* Improved language in *Import workflow* dialog box
* Change default sort order for *Shared Data -> Pages* list to be by update time
* Style updates for embedded items to reduce visual footprint

# Data and Libraries

* In library uploads:
  * Allow inheriting the existing datasets metadata when replacing
  * Allow setting library metadata when adding datasets from a history

# CloudMan

**[CloudMan](/src/cloudman/index.md)**
* A larger tools volume (10GB vs old 2GB) is now the default for any new [CloudMan](/src/cloudman/index.md) cluster making it easier to customize your Galaxy Cloud instances
* A [preliminary support for OpenNebula cloud type](http://bitbucket.org/galaxy/cloudman/src/tip/cm/clouds/opennebula.py) exists within [CloudMan](/src/cloudman/index.md) (thanks to Mattias de Hollander)
* Please continue to use AMI **ami-da58aab3** for Galaxy Cloud clusters, as listed on [usegalaxy.org/cloud](/src/cloudman/index.md). There is another AMI dated from Feb 26, 2012 that was not created by the Galaxy Team and is not supported by us.
