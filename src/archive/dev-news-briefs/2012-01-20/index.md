## Object Store

Galaxy now has a layer between the front end and disk files, and this layer is the **Object Store**.  It allows Galaxy installations to make use of data living in more than simply a single filesystem of locally mounted disk - there are backends for a distributed store (many locally accessible filesystems) or [Amazon S3](http://aws.amazon.com/s3/) (in development).  Configuration is trivial via the Galaxy config file.  See the new **`object_store`** option and those following it!

## Tools

## Galaxy Track Browser (Trackster)

* Recent publication:
    Jeremy Goecks, Kanwei Li, Dave Clements, Team, The Galaxy, James Taylor, *[The Galaxy Track Browser: Transforming the genome browser from visualization tool to analysis tool](http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/freeabs_all.jsp?arnumber=6094046)*. [Biological Data Visualization (BioVis), 2011 IEEE Symposium on](http://www.biovis.net/) (October 2011), pp. 39-46. 
* Simplified user interface that uses icons exclusively for actions.
* Numerous performance improvements.
* SAM datasets (including very deep) can be visualized.
* All rows for feature tracks--BED, GTF, SAM, BAM--can now be displayed.
* Custom composite tracks now available: any amount of wiggle data can be combined into a single track. See Fig.1.

![](/src/images/news-graphics/2012_01_20_composite-tracks.png)<br />
**Fig. 1** shows a Visualization of a "rainbow" composite track generated via a "drag-and-drop" method within the Trackster UI itself. The top three individual conservation tracks are combined into a fourth single composite track underneath.

## Workflows

* SAM merge functionality for job splitting.
* Default static wrapping now works with favicon.ico and robots.txt (and other static files that may need to be mapped to in the future).
* Provide default for robots.txt being pulled from config.
* The email workflow action now happens even on job failure.

## Source

* User interface (UI): A history item's details page (linked from the "View Details" ![](/src/images/icons/HistoryInfo.png) icon) now contains links to the `STDOUT` and `STDERR` captured when running a tool's job command line.
* Job Management: A new setting in the Galaxy config file, `cleanup_job` can take one of three values, `always` (the default), `never`, or `onsuccess`. This controls when temporary data, such as a job's working directory, external metadata files, and DRM output/error files are cleaned up.
* **[JQuery](http://jquery.com/)** updated to 1.7.1
* Updated all tools which were manually filtering on tool_data_tables to determine paths to use built-in param.fields.path.
* Allow select_param.fields.name method of accessing additional attributes from dynamic options work for multiple selects.
* Merged in hanfeisun/galaxy-central-i18n (pull request #26).
* Enhance the datatypes registry to: 
  * (a) enable use of config files that do not include a "sniffers" tag set section 
  * (b) not load a datatype if the registry already includes a datatype with that extension
* Enhance the datatypes registry so that it can be persisted as an xml file, which is then used for all tools instead of the datatypes config file.
* Eliminate all references and support for datatype indexers since they have never been used - datatype converters do the same thing.
* Security: sanitize output anytime a raw text/html dataset is served via dataset/display.
* Security: sanitizer also now removes javascript content from sanitized anchors, and correctly prevents a whitespace loophole.
* ObjectStore: Variable multiple outputs (collect_primary_datasets) and components that use collect_child_datasets tuned for new process.

## Tool Shed

* New features:
  * Add the ability to reset all metadata (for every change set) in a tool shed repository (currently restricted to an admin).
  * Enhance User preferences within a Galaxy tool shed to enable users to elect to receive email when content is first uploaded to a new repository. Also add a new grid interface to enable users to easily manage registering with any tool shed respositories to receive email when changes are made to the selected repositories.
* Existing tool shed fixes:
  * Make the use of the 'require_login' config setting functionally correct for the tool shed, and debug it's use in the Galaxy framework as well.
  * Enhance the process for displaying a workflow in a tool shed repository so that workflows in change sets other than the repository tip can be viewed.
  * Do not allow public user names to be changed within the tool shed if the user has created a tool shed repository.
  * Don't allow repository names to be changed if the repository has been cloned at least 1 time.
* More new tool shed features documented in the following new Galaxy wiki sections:
  * [Including proprietary data types that subclass from Galaxy data types in the distribution](/src/toolshed/index.md#including-proprietary-data-types-that-subclass-from-galaxy-data-types-in-the-distribution)
