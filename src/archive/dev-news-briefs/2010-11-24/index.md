## What's New

### Galaxy's FTP Server New Data Upload Option 

* User how-to: [UploadViaFTP](/src/admin/config/upload-via-ftp/index.md)
* Configuration instructions for local installs: [wiki/Config/UploadViaFTP](http://bitbucket.org/galaxy/galaxy-central/wiki/Config/UploadViaFTP)

### OpenID Login 

* User how-to and config instructions: [wiki/OpenIDAuthentication](http://bitbucket.org/galaxy/galaxy-central/wiki/OpenIDAuthentication)

### NGS Simulation Tool 

* Allows user to simulate multiple Illumina runs with several parameters that can be set. 
  * On each run, one position is randomly chosen to be polymorphic and sequencing errors are also simulated. 
  * The primary output is a png with two different plots. 
  * The other output shows summary statistics about the simulation. 
* NGS simulation tool location: tools/ngs_simulation/ngs_simulation.xml

### Tophat and Cufflinks RNA-seq Tools 

* Addition of RNA-seq analysis tools **Tophat** and **Cufflinks**. 
  * Together, these tools can be used to analyze RNA-seq data to understand alternative splicing and isoforms, gene and isoform expression, and perform statistical tests for differential expression. 
  * Galaxy supports Tophat version 1.1.1 and later and Cufflinks version 0.9.1 and later. (These are the versions included this distribution).

### Import or Export Workflows & Histories  

* **Workflows** can now be downloaded/exported to a file and uploaded/imported into Galaxy, making it easy to move workflows between Galaxy instances.
* Beta feature: **Histories** can also be downloaded or moved from one Galaxy instance to another, subject to these limitations:
  * history archives can be uploaded/imported only via URL, not file
  * histories must be accessible via link in order for them to be importable via archive
  * tags are not currently imported
  * reproducibility is limited as parameters for imported jobs are not always recovered and set

### Even Better Data Visualization with Trackster 

* **Trackster** now supports interactive filtering for **VCF** quality values and BED score values. 
* For example, a user can drag a slider to filter a file of splice junctions to view junctions supported by different numbers of reads.

![trackster splice example](/src/archive/dev-news-briefs/2010-11-24/2010_11_24_trackster_splice_b.png)
* Improved CIGAR support to BAM display. Properly displays matches,

deletions, skipped bases, and clipping. Padding for insertions are
currently not represented in the display.
* GFF feature blocks are now displayed correctly, along with name, strand, and score information.
* General enhancements 
  * Removed right-hand pane, allow inline re-ordering and configuration of elements
  * Moved navigational controls to the top
  * Histogram display for LineTracks and overview
  * New navigational slider and new overview settings under the dropdown corresponding to the track name
  * Summary view now shows maximum y-axis value
  * Can change draw color of LineTrack
  * When editing track config, "Enter" and "Esc" keys submit and cancel the changes, respectively
  * Don't index bottom level for summary_tree, greatly reducing computation time (>5x speedup) while not sacrificing usability Refactored to pass JSLint
* Tuning
  * Fix ReferenceTrack issue.
  * Don't re-add new datasets when refreshing after using "Add into current viz" link.
  * To prevent browser lockup, only display up to 50 lines of features by default (user-editable in future). Coming soon: add warning message when this occurs.
  * Fix LineTrack rendering bug when more than one tile on screen.

### Native Data set Re-organization 

* Galaxy now uses a set of data tables instead of simple loc files to organize, document, and store native genome data sets.
* Why Data tables? Better data management for long term stability!
  * Allows the information in the loc file, including the path, to be changed.
  * By using a unique ID as the parameter value, data links in existing workflows are preserved.
* Most tools (PerM, Bowtie, BWA, Lastz, Megablast, SRMA, Tophat) that previously used loc files now have the new data tables organization implemented.
* Better data tracking has allowed for more informative genome name display in tool dropdown boxes. 
* For local installations:
  * See the new wiki describing how to use data tables: [wiki/DataTables](/src/admin/tools/Data Tables/index.md)
  * More help for NGS tool setup (update pending): [wiki/NGSLocalSetup](/src/admin/NGS Local Setup/index.md)

----

## Updated & Improved

### Sample Tracking 

* Complete re-write of the **Framework** and **User interface** (database schema unchanged).  
* New interactive interface to select files to transfer from the sequencer to Galaxy data libraries.
* The data transfer feature now uses Galaxy RESTful API.
* Full documentation detailing the new functionality and how to use it will be available within a few weeks through the home [Galaxy Wiki](http://bitbucket.org/galaxy/galaxy-central/wiki/Home).

### Instantiating Galaxy 

* New checkouts will now perform all necessary setup directly in run.sh, there is no longer a need to run setup.sh prior to run.sh. (setup.sh will be removed in a future distribution).

### Analysis Tools 

* Enable **'FASTX-Toolkit for FASTQ data**' as a subsection under 'NGS: QC and manipulation' in tool_conf.xml.sample/main. Includes special handling for when the shell only allows for strict Bourne syntax.
* Add descriptive labels to output dataset names for **MACS** peakcalling tool.
* **Taxonomy** tools updated for better error reporting. Includes special handling for when the shell only allows for strict Bourne syntax.
* Refactor sam_bitwise_flag_filter tool, simplifying it and making it faster when there are multiple flag criteria

### Tool Dependency Enhancements 

* Addition of the 'package' type to <requirement> tags in the tool config. 1 Syntax for tool configs is:

```
  <requirements>
    <requirement type='package' version='X.Y.Z'>NAME</requirement>
  </requirements>
```

2 Next, a directory should be created, and the path to that directory should be set in universe_wsgi.ini as 'tool_dependency_dir'.

3 Galaxy will then source the following file prior to executing the tool's
<command>:
```
  <tool_dependency_dir>/<NAME>/<X.Y.Z>/env.sh
```

4 The 'version' attribute of the 'requirement' tag is optional and if left
off, Galaxy will look for the following instead:
```
  <tool_dependency_dir>/<NAME>/default/env.sh
```


### Data Libraries 

* UI: new style for dropdown menus.
* Now uses jStore to save folder expansion state.
* Pre-generate and cache variables so that expensive functions like jQuery.siblings, jQuery.filter and jQuery.find only have to be called a minimum amount of times. Provides significant speedup to loading of large data libraries.

### Genome Indexes 

* Add basic support for **Bowtie** indexes as a datatype (bowtie_base_index, bowtie_color_index), available via datatype conversion. Currently, the indexes need to be converted manually from the FASTA file before use in Bowtie, but they can be reused.
* A new sample loc file (tool-data/all_fasta.loc.sample) was added which lists fasta files. A script (scripts/loc_files/create_all_fasta_loc.py) was created that can be used to generate this loc file for local installations.

### Data Formats 

* New **gff2bed** tool to convert GFF3 files to BED.
* Modified Filter and Sort -> **Filter** tool to operate correctly on files with a variable number of columns, such as in SAM files.
* New datatype added: **VCF** (variant call format).

### Histories 

* Add descriptive labels to output dataset names for **MACS** peakcalling tool.
* Add name/designation to HDA name for new datasets created in collect_primary_datasets.

### Workflow Tuning 

* Shift management of the interaction between workflow outputs and HideDatasetActions to the front end editor.  
* No usability changes, but this resolves the issue with multiple HideDatasetActions being created.  
* Existing workflows displaying multiple HideDatasetActions per step on the Run Workflow screen will persist.  These extra HideDatasetActions are harmless, but a simple edit workflow -> save will remove them.
* Workflow Inputs change:
  * Workflow inputs that aren't a subtype of text, were previously not an option.  
  * Added 'data' datatype to registry, which will allow both text and binary inputs (and their subtypes) to workflow input steps.  
  * Note that this will allow a user to change the datatype of something to 'data'.

### User Interface (UI) 

* New function for downloading metadata files associated with datasets

(such as bai indices for bam files). See the Save icon drop-down menu.
* Enable display of unicode characters in history and workflow annotations and when listing and running workflows.
* Dynamicically generated popup-style menus. Greatly improves load

time, especially for data libraries having potentially large menu.
* Labels next to checkboxes can now be clicked to check the corresponding box.
* Radio boxes in tool forms now also have clickable labels as well.
* New style for search boxes in grids. Grid items will no longer show outline when hovered upon if there are no actions to be performed.
* Refactored refresh_on_change javascript code to run in galaxy.base when the page is loaded.
* Remove the creation of a background element that closes the active menu clicked. Instead, bind an event to close active menus to the document object of current and all other framesets. Tested in IE.
* Make links in split menu buttons "go through" instead of popping up the menu options.

### General 

* Functional Test Framework: new nose plugin that shows a diff between tests failed this time and last time.
* Documentation update to add more options added to the sample config file.

### Bug Fixes! 

* Fix for TextToolParameter.get_html_field when provided value is an empty string but default value specified in tool is non-empty string. Fixes issue with rerun button where if a user had input an empty string, the form displayed when rerun would have the default value from the tool and not the actual previously specified value.
* Fix for Integer[/FloatToolParameter](/src/archive/dev-news-briefs/2010-11-24/FloatToolParameter/index.md).get_html_field() when 'value' is provided as an integer/float. Fixes an issue seen when saving workflows: If an integer or float tool parameter is changed to a value of 0 or 0.0 and saved, the form field would be redisplayed using the default tool value; and not the value that is now saved in the database.
* Fix for setting columns in workflow builder for ColumnListParameter. e.g. allows splitting lists of columns by newlines and commas and strips leading 'c's.
* Fixes for rerun action to recurse grouping options when checking unvalidated values and cloned HDAs. Better selection of corresponding HDAs from cloned histories, when multiple copies exist.
* Have rerun action make use of tool.check_and_update_param_values(). Fixes Server Error issue when trying to rerun updated tools.
* Fix for display framework to work with workflows that contain tools that have been updated.  Previously, this would cause a server error when trying to view a workflow or a page with an embedded workflow that contained an updated tool.
* Fix bug that was causing Page item selection grids to be initialized twice and hence causing grid paging to fail.
* Add some space between adjacent embedded items on Pages.
* Fix path to closebox.png image so screencast close button is shown correctly.
* Fix the Admin -> Manage Jobs interface when using multiple Galaxy processes
* When possible (e.g. Python >= 2.6), don't use tons of memory to handle zipped uploads.
* Fix cluster stdout/stderr handling that could cause excessive memory usage if stdout/stderr were very large.
* Make the PBS runner actually stop jobs when a user deletes output. This would only work before if the Galaxy user was a PBS "operator" and only using a single process setup.
* Cause waiting jobs to fail if any of their inputs fail to set metadata correctly.
* Fix 'import from current history' for Data Libraries that was showing metadata files that are not visible. Fix this same issue for 'Copy history items' feature.
* DRMAA runner now uses get_id_tag() in Wrapper instead of job_id directly for creation of .sh .o and .e files, as well as some debugging.
* Prevent Rename Dataset Action from allowing a blank input.
