# Upgrades

* **Review instructions for core build: [Getting the Stable Distribution](http://getgalaxy.org)**
* **Review reset for Tool Shed repos: [Resetting Metadata For Installed Repositories](http://wiki.galaxyproject.org/ResettingMetadataForInstalledRepositories)**

<br />
# Tool Migrations

### Galaxy Tool Migrations

**This release includes additional *tools* that have been migrated from the Galaxy distribution to the Tool Shed**.  

As in prior releases, Galaxy tool migration framework has been enhanced so that tool entries in the `tool_conf.xml` file for tools that were [migrated out of the Galaxy distribution](http://wiki.galaxyproject.org/MigratingToolsFromGalaxyDistribution#Migrating_tools_from_the_Galaxy_distribution_to_the_Galaxy_Main_tool_shed) are now automatically eliminated during the migration process.  

* It is no longer necessary to manually edit the `tool_conf.xml` file to eliminate entries for migrated tools.  
* A back-up copy of the original `tool_conf.xml` file is made.
* Associated files, such as location sample files (".loc"), are also removed from the distribution.
* The list of migrated tools can be found here: *[migrated 009](https://bitbucket.org/galaxy/galaxy-central/src/694411e94d9aa26c9b9a2c13567b2b5e07f74580/lib/tool_shed/galaxy_install/migrate/versions/0009_tools.py?at=default)*

<br />
# Tools & Data

1. *GenomeSpace*: Improved import when initiated from within Galaxy. https://trello.com/c/maFhnXpN
1. *[DataProviders](/src/data-providers/index.md)*: See http://wiki.galaxyproject.org[/DataProviders](/src/archive/dev-news-briefs/2014-02-10/DataProviders/index.md) https://trello.com/c/Qic2fVPE
1. *Cuffdiff*: A read_group.info dataset is now included in the output. https://trello.com/c/FdUYdbIn

<br />
# Visualizations

1. *Phyloviz*: Saving as visualization corrected. https://trello.com/c/dzBmbyqF
1. *Scatterplot*: Improvements to large data loading. https://trello.com/c/8or6FdE2
1. *Trackster*: 
  * Standalone web application(s) for visualizations. https://trello.com/c/i0yW8IgQ
  * Correct issue where attempting to set a custom build that has not finished processing resulted in unrecoverable infinite recursion. https://trello.com/c/AWyQSQ8F
  * CSS styling improvements include:
    * overlaying track header on track data to compress track height; this enables more data to be viewed simultaneously
    * grayscale drawing for mapped reads so that variation can easily be seen
    * using colors to denote track state (e.g. pending, error, etc.)
