# Release Versioning

Starting with this distribution, an updated Galaxy release versioning system has been implemented. The versioning scheme is [Ubuntu-style](https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Releases). 

Releases versioning details are as follows:

* A `version_major` key has been added to `/api/configuration`.
* The file [version.py](https://github.com/galaxyproject/galaxy/blob/master/lib/galaxy/version.py) is the source of `version_major`.
* "Point" releases will be created periodically with updates to the release.
* "Point" releases are versioned as `YY.MM.point`, where ».point« begins at `.1` and increments for each point release.
* The first version is »15.03«, where the tag for the release is »v15.03«.
* Stable updates to »15.03« will be »15.03.1«, »15.03.2«, where the tag for the release is formatted as »v15.03.1«.
* Backwards compatibility: The tag »latest_15.03« in Bitbucket will always point to the newest »15.03« changeset.
* [XvAhmlb0](https://trello.com/c/XvAhmlb0) [ZHGSGosl](https://trello.com/c/ZHGSGosl)

# Release Branches

* The Github [master](https://github.com/galaxyproject/galaxy/tree/master) branch is similar to the former Bitbucket [stable](https://bitbucket.org/galaxy/galaxy-dist/branch/stable) branch. The difference is that whereas individual commits to the current stable release were previously applied to the stable branch, they are now only applied in a group, when a "point" release is made (e.g. `15.03.1`). 
* The Bitbucket stable branch now works the same way as the Github master branch.
* Permanent named branches are now created for each release. The 15.03 release is in the [release_15.03](https://github.com/galaxyproject/galaxy/tree/release_15.03) branch, which will be updated with additional changes throughout the lifecycle of this release, as was done with the Bitbucket `stable` branch in the past. When the Galaxy Team determines that a "point" release is necessary, this branch is merged to `master` and a point release tag is created. This branch exists in both the [Github](https://github.com/galaxyproject/galaxy) and [Bitbucket](https://bitbucket.org/galaxy/galaxy-dist) versions of Galaxy.

Thus, if you would like to upgrade to the 15.03 release and ensure you do not subsequently upgrade to the release after 15.03 (i.e. 15.05) when it is made, you can use the `release_15.03` branch. If you would always like to run the latest release (recommended), you should use the `master` (Git) or `stable` (Bitbucket) branch.

# Tool Redesign

Much of Galaxy’s core tool set has been redesigned. Several contain new functionality. These tools are included in the [Tool Shed](http://usegalaxy.org/toolsehd) and many are ready for use on Galaxy [Main](/src/main/index.md). Older Workflows may contain tools that automatically map to the new tools or Workflows may need minor adjustments. [c6Lkejro](https://trello.com/c/c6Lkejro) 

Be sure to check out the new [Galaxy NGS 101](/src/learn/galaxy-ngs101/index.md) wiki (in progress). 

# Github

<div class='right'><a href='https://github.com/galaxyproject/galaxy'><img src="/src/images/logos/GitHubLogoText.png" alt="Galaxy on GitHub" width="100" /></a></div>

Galaxy development has moved to [Github](https://github.com/galaxyproject/galaxy), but stable/release changes are mirrored to Bitbucket. Deployers can continue to use Bitbucket as they have done in the past.
