# Security

<!> On July 31st, we fixed a serious security vulnerability in Galaxy and notified the community. Please ***upgrade immediately*** if you haven’t done so already: [Instructions](http://tinyurl.com/nhgmbc5)

Many thanks to Inge Alexander Raknes for reporting the issue [T1eldqfK](https://trello.com/c/T1eldqfK). Stay connected! We both [email](https://wiki.galaxyproject.org/MailingLists) and [tweet](https://twitter.com/galaxyproject) security alerts.

# New! Citations

[Wiki](http://wiki.galaxyproject.org/Admin/Tools/ToolConfigSyntax#A.3Ccitations.3E_tag_set), Authored by Björn Grüning and Peter Cock

Tools now annotate citation information. Tools annotate citations using either DOIs or raw BibTeX - these in turn are shown as formatted citations below the help text on tool forms and may be copied to reference managers as raw `BibTeX`. All annotated citations in a history can also be obtained using the history options menu. [kY7RCnd0](https://trello.com/c/kY7RCnd0)	

# New! Docker

<div class='right'><a href='http://wiki.galaxyproject.org/Admin/Tools/Docker'><img src="/src/images/logos/DockerInGalaxyAnnotated.png" alt=" " width=220 /></a></div>

[Wiki](https://wiki.galaxyproject.org/Admin/Tools/Docker), Authored by Helena Rasche

Added tool-to-container mechanism to package dependencies that tool developers can provide as an alternative to requirements and Galaxy's `tool_dependency_dir`. You can now create »Dockerized« tools, meaning tools which run within a docker container. [9lGgDlOJ](https://trello.com/c/9lGgDlOJ)

Docker integration provides even greater security with [Pulsar](https://github.com/galaxyproject/pulsar) (formerly called the LWR) to expose only the staged job directory to the running container. [fUOhP58d](https://trello.com/c/fUOhP58d)

# Improved

1. Improved data loading efficiency in Trackster through »reference-based« compression for read tracks. [qoDpckp7](https://trello.com/c/qoDpckp7)
1. DRMAA Python version in eggs.ini updated to 0.7.6. This version has better string handling and supports Python 3. Upgraded by Dan Blanchard. [E6h7wold](https://trello.com/c/E6h7wold)
1. Added extension point to define site-specific parameters to aid defining job destinations. Based on contributions from Hector del Risco. [H87LotF7](https://trello.com/c/H87LotF7)	
1. Per-destination concurrency limits for jobs linked to destination or destination tag. Aids in avoiding queue bottlenecks or user »quota-exceeded« job rejections/failures. [o40wcWaU](https://trello.com/c/o40wcWaU)
1. Enhanced dynamic job destinations throw new `JobNotReadyException` to indicate delayed decision. [xdf6ibmC](https://trello.com/c/xdf6ibmC)
1. Created higher-level utilities about job metrics and users to better track and manage priorities (i.e. do it yourself meta-fairshare). [wDjPSAsy](https://trello.com/c/wDjPSAsy)
1. Setting user preferences, toolbox filters, and default permissions now accessible when using external authentication. [AnUdQJqj](https://trello.com/c/AnUdQJqj)

1. Added sqlite datatype and corresponding dataprovider and followed up with improved sqlite whitelisting by using the sqlparse package. Developed by Ira Cooke. [2e0ulmi1](https://trello.com/c/2e0ulmi1) [tNaEWcg7](https://trello.com/c/tNaEWcg7)

1. Workflow `PostJobActions` function »`Rename`« now displays available tool inputs for `#{input1} ` as options (custom label or actual tool input id). Additional `PostJobActions` functions to be enhanced in future upgrades. [9HkqqTut](https://trello.com/c/9HkqqTut)
1. Action "create new workflow" now opens directly into a workflow »Edit« view, after setting name and annotation. [i8d5egqY](https://trello.com/c/i8d5egqY)
1. Easier to use input mapping when running workflows. A new parameter 'inputs' can now be specified. Additionally, "inputs" is more flexible and can revert to the old behavior by specifying a new parameters. [wzp0TcVq](https://trello.com/c/wzp0TcVq)
1. The workflows API now displays annotations in detail view. [wJVEsJvI](https://trello.com/c/wJVEsJvI)
1. Enable stopping jobs when history is deleted via the API and update comments related to stopping jobs when a history is deleted using the API. Authored and tuned by Ilya Sytchev. [GE7vF8lA](https://trello.com/c/GE7vF8lA) [PgiFQMMj](https://trello.com/c/PgiFQMMj) [Tbota8xG](https://trello.com/c/Tbota8xG)
1. Option to delete, rather than hide, intermediate datasets in workflows through the use of `PostJobActions`. [YfLGkJKe](https://trello.com/c/YfLGkJKe)
1. Ability to locate tools relative to the `tool_conf` file using a string through the template resolution of `${tool_conf_dir} `. [IABOzpVk](https://trello.com/c/IABOzpVk)
1. New dataset collections prototype for creating a dataset collection of pairs (a list of N paired collections). More enhancements planned: manually pair datasets and permit re-ordering. [CIIdaxl2](https://trello.com/c/CIIdaxl2)
1. Add API methods for copying dataset collections between histories. [s5tJOmQC](https://trello.com/c/s5tJOmQC)
1. Allow using data collection steps via workflow API. Implement API test for this and upgrade test for previous commit related improved workflow run endpoint. [0MY3X3SG](https://trello.com/c/0MY3X3SG)
1. Rename LWR to Pulsar - eliminate older LWR cruft debris and provide deeper Galaxy integration and easier configuration. [OO22czXz](https://trello.com/c/OO22czXz)
1. Non-daemon asynchronous LWR operation implemented along with other relevant upgrades. [xjlJH3N4](https://trello.com/c/xjlJH3N4)
1. Update LWR client to allow configuration of file actions via YAML. [jbEnWNB4](https://trello.com/c/jbEnWNB4)
1. Implemented Tool Shed checksums, including the dependent `setup_python_environment` changes. In collaboration with Björn Grüning. [RG2Undyx](https://trello.com/c/RG2Undyx) [c6oLfsli](https://trello.com/c/c6oLfsli)
1. More MQ configuration for exception states in the LWR client. [mUlMj6l9](https://trello.com/c/mUlMj6l9)

1. Tabular display improved for datasets having a large number of columns. Now fills viewable container window without additional UI scrolling. Display »chunk size« is now configurable. Request and Testing from Peter Cock. [28dasaLn](https://trello.com/c/28dasaLn) [4IrKYxy6](https://trello.com/c/4IrKYxy6)
1. Because `package_ncurses_5_9` fails to build on filesystems that don't support hardlinks, now enable symlinks by default. Developed by Björn Grüning. [bIolgPxx](https://trello.com/c/bIolgPxx)
1. Datasource Tools are using provided name on Job executed page (added in an earlier release). [qjaaGcRg](https://trello.com/c/qjaaGcRg)
1. Added to Toolshed repository actions the ability to Uninstall an installed repository that is in an error state and to delete a repository that is in a "new" state. [GbPdcxOp](https://trello.com/c/GbPdcxOp)
1. Decided to strip() the repository names from the Toolshed "create repository" form. [NGUuuCRj](https://trello.com/c/NGUuuCRj)

# Fixed

# Gossip

1. Did you read above that LWR was officially renamed to PULSAR ? We don’t normally tag our own, but there’s a rumor his initials are *John Chilton*, or was it [Natefoo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interstellar_communication)?
1. Galaxy CHARTS were a big wow! on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/galaxyproject), and we thank you for that, but they didn’t make the last News Brief. Get caught up and make sure you don’t miss the full color **[Charts Wiki](https://wiki.galaxyproject.org/Learn/Visualization/Charts)** <div class='red'>this</span> <div class='blue'>time</span> <div class='green'>around</span> !
1. Docker, Docker, [DOCKER](https://www.docker.com) .. chant (er, VOTE) in [Trello](https://wiki.galaxyproject.org/Issues) and you shall likely receive.
1. Psss… we migrated a few tools off Main, but they’re enjoying good company in the Toolshed until you need them. Find your favorite `SOLiD` mapping tools there: [BWA](https://toolshed.g2.bx.psu.edu/view/devteam/bwa_wrappers) & [Bowtie](https://toolshed.g2.bx.psu.edu/view/devteam/bowtie_color_wrappers)
1. And we heard that there is quite a bit of deploy and config going on over at the [Galaxy Biostars](http://biostar.usegalaxy.org) forum. From where oh where will the advice come from next? Claiming one’s account is tricky - first you need to log into your [Main](http://usegalaxy.org) account, next find a tool form, and then finally click a button in the upper right corner.
