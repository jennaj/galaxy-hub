## What's New

### Workflow API

An **API for executing workflows** has been added.
#### Usage examples

/scripts/api/workflow_execute.py<br />
/scripts/api/example_watch_folder.py.

### Move Data Library Items

We have introduced a feature that enables you to move library datasets or folders (including all folder contents) to other locations within the same data library or to a different data library altogether. 

Galaxy administrators can perform this feature on any data library item and can move items to any data library.  Users that are not Galaxy administrators must be given the modify library item permission on an item in order to move it, and they'll need the add library item permission on the desired target data library folder in order for it to be displayed in the select list of targets. 

#### Moving a single dataset

To move a single dataset, select the **Move this dataset** option from the dataset's pop-up menu.

![](/src/archive/dev-news-briefs/2011-04-08/2011_04_08_g1_move_dataset.png)

The default behavior is to move items to other locations within the same data library, so you'll initially be presented with a list of valid folders from which to choose for the new target location.

![](/src/archive/dev-news-briefs/2011-04-08/2011_04_08_g2_select_folder.png)

After selecting the desired folder, clicking the **Move** button will move the dataset to the selected folder.

#### Moving a Folder

Moving a folder is very similar to moving a single dataset - just select the **Move this folder** option from the folder's pop-up menu.

![](/src/archive/dev-news-briefs/2011-04-08/2011_04_08_g3_move_folder.png)

To move the folder to a different data library, after selecting the **Move this folder** option, click the __Choose another data library__ link on the **Move data library items** page. The  folders select list will change to a select list of data libraries to which you are authorized to move the item.  When you select a target data library, the select list will change again to display the list of folders in the selected data library to which you are authorized to move the item. Clicking the **Move** button will move the folder and all of it's contents to the selected target folder within the selected target data library.  

The target folders select list is filtered to include only valid folders to which you can move the item.  For example, you cannot move a folder to one of it's own sub-folders in one step.  To do this, the sub-folder must be moved outside of it's parent, and then the parent can be moved to the folder that it previously contained.

* **Current Galaxy Main Genomes**
  * [http://bitbucket.org/galaxy/galaxy-central/wiki/GenomeData](http://bitbucket.org/galaxy/galaxy-central/wiki/GenomeData ) 

### Current Tools

* Add more verbose error reporting to **FASTQ Groomer** tool. Provides more information to allow users to determine what is wrong with *FASTQ* files with invalid format.
* Enhance *Bowtie* wrapper to accept non-Sanger variant *FASTQ* files.
* Allow **Upload Tool** to function on `https` URLs.
* Add count *GFF* features tool and tests: 
  * Filter and Sort -->  GFF -->  **Filter GFF file by feature count using simple expressions**.
  * Tool counts the number of features in a *GFF* file. Note: this is different than the number of lines because a single *GFF* feature can often span multiple lines.
* *Tophat* v1.2.0 support: 
  * (a) allow indel search.
  * (b) max insertion and max deletion lengths.
  * (c) library type.
* Updated **`gff_filter_by_feature_count`** tool now accepts and correctly handles all *GTF*, *GFF*, and *GFF3* files.
* Changes for **detecting and loading *BAM* data type**
    *Samtools* version 0.1.13 or newer produces an error condition when attempting to index an unsorted *BAM* file.  To determine if a *BAM* file is sorted, we first use *Samtools* to check the headers.  If this does not provide a definitive answer and *Samtools* version 0.1.13 or newer is being used, we index the *BAM* file to see if it produces the error.  This process provides a more robust approach to determining if the *BAM* file is sorted.

### New Tools

* **Multiple Alignments: *ClustalW*** multiple sequence alignment program for DNA or proteins.
* **Motif Tools: Sequence Logo** generator for *FASTA* data (example: *ClustalW* alignment).
  * Both tools originated from the Community Tool Shed (see below).
  * The **Sequence Logo** tool uses *Weblogo3* wrapped into **Galaxy** to generate a sequence logo. The input file must be a *FASTA* file in your current history. It is recommended for viewing multiple-sequence alignment output from the *ClustalW* tool. Set the *ClustalW* output to *FASTA* to create the input for this tool. 

#### A typical output looks like this:

![](/src/archive/dev-news-briefs/2011-04-08/2011_04_08_rgWebLogo3_test.jpg)

### Community Tools (Tool Shed)

* Tuning: Clarified what is being searched in the **Tool Shed**.
* New ***ClustalW*** wrapper (see http://www.clustal.org) for protein/dna multiple alignments based on the Galaxy *ClustalW* wrapper posted by [Hans-Rudolf Hotz](/src/people/hansrudolf-hotz/index.md) [in an email on the developer list](http://lists.bx.psu.edu/pipermail/galaxy-dev/2010-November/003732.html)
* New *Weblogo3* wrapper ([http://weblogo.berkeley.edu](http://weblogo.berkeley.edu)) that creates sequence logos from *FASTA* data such as the output from a *ClustalW* alignment.

### Data Libraries

* Disabled problematic eager loading on data libraries.  Very large data libraries will load two to three times quicker.
* Upload Improvement with example walk-through: 

#### Uploading data library datasets

1. Apply a corrected version of the patch from Peter Cock that flips the "Preserve directory structure?" setting when uploading library datasets from filesystem paths.  The checkbox is now "yes" instead of the original "no", and is checked by default.

![](/src/archive/dev-news-briefs/2011-04-08/2011_04_08_g5_preserve.png)

2. Flip the behavior of the "Copy data into Galaxy" feature when uploading library datasets (similar to 1 above) to be more clear and logical.  Instead of a single checkbox, this is now a select list with clearly defined options.  The default setting is to copy the files into the configured Galaxy file store.

![](/src/archive/dev-news-briefs/2011-04-08/2011_04_08_g6_copy_files.png)

3. Allow importing items from a history to replace a library dataset with a new version.  Previously, you could only replace a library dataset with a new version by uploading a single file.

![](/src/archive/dev-news-briefs/2011-04-08/2011_04_08_g7_replace_dataset.png)

### Workflows

* Users can now import copies of their own **Workflows** and **Histories**.

### Trackster

* **Enhancements**:
  * Implemented a data manager for **Trackster** and drawing is now completely tracked and controlled.
  * Put show_insertions and show_differences in read track `config`.
  * Filtering now supports:
    * (a) score columns in *BED* and *GFF*.
    * (b) *GTF* attributes.
  * Added *BED* and *GFF* support to visual analytics framework, and enable GOPS intersect and subtract tools to work with visual analytics.
* **Improvements**:
  * Insertions and deletions now shown in reads.
  * Save and restore mode for feature and read tracks.
  * Bug fixes for drawing feature tracks in `Squish` and `Dense` mode.
  * Menus and menu items now work correctly.
  * Remove form from navigation controls so that enter key works properly and sets the chrom/low/high.
  * Enable full keyboard navigation via arrow keys.
* **Bug fixes**:
  * Fix issues with navigation input: 
    * (a) arrow keys no longer perform navigation
    * (b) invalid chromosome names are handled well.
  * Fix feature track bugs so that intervals are correctly drawn as half-open.
  * Use gap to correctly position read connector in `Pack` mode.
  * Fix read id bug in Trackster *BAM* data provider.

#### Example of Trackster visualization:

Track of reads mapped using *Tophat* (spliced) including the transcript assembled from those reads.

### User Interface (UI)

* SGD Yeast genome added as a *Gbrowse* display site.
* *IGV* added as an external display application. This is not enabled on Galaxy main, but is available for local instances.

### CloudMan

* `FTP` data upload enabled.
    [http://bitbucket.org/galaxy/galaxy-central/wiki/cloud](http://bitbucket.org/galaxy/galaxy-central/wiki/cloud)

### Source

* Improvements in reliability and speed regarding manipulation of instance data volumes.
* The value set in '`new_file_path`' in `universe_wsgi.ini` will now be used for creation of all temporary files.  This obviates the need for setting `$TEMP` when running data source tools on the cluster.
* Datatypes:
  * Add a '`subclass`' flag to datatype definitions in `datatypes_conf.xml` that allows dynamic creation of a subclass.
  * Allow composite datatype datasets to be populated in the **Upload** tool from files that were uploaded to the Galaxy FTP server.
* Tool configuration enhancements:
  * Allow `DataToolParameter` to be filtered on attributes other than `dbkey` (dynamic options).
  * Allow `FromParamToolOutputActionOption` and `ParamValueToolOutputActionOptionFilter` to access attributes of parameter values.

### Tool Test Framework

* Specifying '`ftype="bam"`' as a parameter on a test's `<output>` tag will now cause the test framework to use '`samtools view`' to convert the file to *SAM*.  This should make it easier to debug why the test tool output differs from your baseline test output.

Test framework enhancements:
* Allow `toolbox tests` to upload a file found located in `subdirectories`. 
* Fix a bug occurring on the determination of uploaded dataset name during the handling of the removal of `.gzip` or `.zip` extension from the uploaded filenames.
* When using `re_match comparison method` in functional tests and line counts do not match, print out first 40 lines of the history file.

### Admin Menu

* Add a checkbox to the **Create Group** page that if checked will create a new *`Role`* with the same name. This provides a similar feature the the existing checkbox on the **Create Role** page. 
* However, the behavior is now changed such that new associations are created when the checkbox is checked, whereas before, only the *`Group`* or *`Role`* objects with the same name were created, but not associated with anything.

### Bug Fixes

* Following the __login__ link from the **Logout** page no longer redirects you to the **Logout** page once you have logged in.
* The peek setting method, `set_peek()`, should now function consistently across datatypes descending from `Text`, particularly with respect to line count estimation.
* Apply patch from Ry4an Brase to correct "NoneType preference on the jobs view" issue.
* Don't alter the contents of a file while uploading to a data library if using one of the **Upload files from file system paths** or **Upload a directory of files** options in conjunction with the **Link to files without copying into Galaxy** option. This partially resolves the issue where a supposedly sorted *BAM* file was being resorted upon upload to a data library when using this option. A better implementation of determining whether a *BAM* file has been sorted (so that it does not get resorted) remains to be done.
* **Extract Genomic DNA** tool: 
  * Do not fix strand for *GFF* input.
  * Handle *non-GFF* files when interpret features is `true`.
* Set default value for *Cuffdiff's* minimum alignment count parameter to reflect v0.9.3.
* Enhance *GFF* reader to handle headers and comments and fix bug so that new feature starts when `transcript_id` or `gene_id` changes.
* Suppress most logging for *Cufflinks* and *Cuffdiff* as the logging can generate output that is incompatible with `UTF-8 format` used by database.
* Set message type to error when history deletion fails due to sharing.
* Show masthead links to **Published Visualizations** and **Published Pages** only if **Tracks** or **Pages** are enabled.
* Shared visualizations work again.
* Fix bug in `recently used tool submenu`.
* Change default value for *Tophat* coverage search to `true`.
