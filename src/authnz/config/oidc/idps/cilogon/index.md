title: Configure Your Galaxy Instance as a CILogon OIDC Client
highlight: true
---

_This page explains how to configure this feature, for user-specific docs, please refer to [this](/src/authnz/use/oidc/idps/cilogon/index.md) page._

Leveraging OpenID Connect (OIDC) protocol, users can login to Galaxy with their
exsiting insitutional login credentials by using [CILogon](https://www.cilogon.org/oidc),
without having to (explicitly) create a Galaxy user account. To
enable this feature on your Galaxy instance, you would need to first register
you a client on the CILogon portal and await approval of your client, then
use your registration information to configure Galaxy. These steps are described
in details in the following sections.

# Client Registration

Take the following steps in order to register a client with CILogon on its OAuth2.0 authorization server:

Visit the [CILogon OIDC/OAuth 2.0 Client Registration page](https://cilogon.org/oauth2/register)
and fill out the form with the appropriate information according to
your Galaxy instance:

1. The _Home URL_ should be the main address that users will use to get to your instance of Galaxy.

2. For the _Callback URLs_ field, you need to enter
   your instanceâ€™s OIDC redirect URI, which is in the following template:

   ```
   <Host URI>/authnz/cilogon/callback
   ```

   For instance:

   ```
   http://localhost:8080/authnz/cilogon/callback
   ```

   See [this section](/src/authnz/config/oidc/index.md#redirect-uri) for details.

3. After filling out the form, hit _Register Client_ and wait for approval from the CILogon team.
   Upon approval, the notification email will include your OAuth `Client ID` and `Client Secret`;
   note this info! You will need it for the Galaxy configuration.

# Galaxy Configuration

You would need to setup you Galaxy instance to leverage OIDC protocol.
This setup is common for all OIDC IdPs, and is
[documented at this page](/src/authnz/config/oidc/index.md#configure-oidc-backends).
Then you would need to add CILogon-specific setters to the `config/oidc_backends_config.xml` file as in the following. Note that the **redirect_uri** must have been included in the list of callback URLs during your CILogon client registration:

```xml
<?xml version="1.0"?>
<OIDC>
    <provider name="CILogon">
        <url>https://cilogon.org/authorize</url>
        <client_id> ... </client_id>
        <client_secret> ... </client_secret>
        <redirect_uri>http://localhost:8080/authnz/cilogon/callback</redirect_uri>
        <realm>master</realm>
    </provider>
</OIDC>
```

See [this section](/src/authnz/config/oidc/index.md#supported-oidc-idps)
for more details.

Having set this configuration, restart Galaxy to have the option to login to
Galaxy using CILogon by selecting your institution from the list and entering the login credentials.
