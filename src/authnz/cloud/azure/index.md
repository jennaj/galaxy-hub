On this page we explain how to setup a *service principal* on Azure, and how to configure Galaxy to assume 
that *service principal*. 

## Step 1: Create an Azure Service Principal

1. Goto [portal.azure.com](https://portal.azure.com) and login with your Azure credentials. 
2. Select **Azure Active Directory > App registrations**, then click **New registration** 
(as shown on the following figure).

3. Enter a name for the application, and click on the **Register** button (see the following figure).

4. On the application **Overview** window, take note of **Application (client) ID** and **Directory (tenant) ID**
(see the following figure).

5. Select **Certificates & secrets**, then click on the **New client secret*** button, and take note of the value
(see the following figure).

## Step 2: Setup Galaxy to Use an Azure Service Principal

To setup Galaxy to use a service principal, you need to `POST` a payload as the following to 
`/api/cloud/authz` API of Galaxy: 

```
{
  "provider": "azure",
  "authn_id":"...",
  "config": {
  	"tenant_id": "...",
  	"client_id": "...",
  	"client_secret": "..."
  }
}
```

You can obtain `authn_id` by submitting a `GET` request to the `/authnz/` controller (e.g., `http://127.0.0.1:8080/authnz/` . 

See the following figure as an example, which uses [Postman](https://www.getpostman.com) to send the API requests.
