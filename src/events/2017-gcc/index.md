[GCC2017](https://gcc2017.sciencesconf.org/) is the 8th annual gathering of the
Galaxy community. The conference will include keynotes and accepted talks,
poster sessions, demos, birds-of-a-feather meetups, exhibitors, and plenty of
networking opportunities. There will also be three days of pre-conference
activities, including hackathons and training. If you work in data-intensive
biomedical research, there is no better place than GCC2017 to present your work
and to learn from others.
