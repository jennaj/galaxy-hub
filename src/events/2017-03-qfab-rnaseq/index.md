This hands-on workshop introduces the concepts of RNA-Seq analysis, from data preparation through to statistical testing for differential gene expression, along with more advanced topics such as identification of novel transcription features and pathway and functional enrichment analysis.

The workshop will focus on the use of Galaxy, a platform that provides a simple and user-friendly interface to bioinformatics tools, and will also feature an introduction to other freely-available RNA-Seq analysis resources.
