Processing, statistical analysis, and annotation of metabolomics data is a complex task for experimenters since it involves many steps and requires a good knowledge of both the methodology and software tools. The Workflow4metabolomics.org (W4M) online infrastructure provides a user-friendly and high-performance environment with advanced computational modules for building, running, and sharing complete workflows for LC-MS, GC-MS, and NMR analysis (Giacomoni et al, 2015). Such functionalities are of major values for teaching computational metabolomics to experimenters, and previous courses using W4M since 2014 have been very successful (with an average number of participants of 25).
