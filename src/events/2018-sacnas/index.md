## Do you have data and don’t know where to start with analysis?

[<img class="float-right" src="/src/events/2018-sacnas/sacnas-2018-flier-thumb.png" />](https://depot.galaxyproject.org/hub/attachments/events/2018-sacnas/2018-sacnas-flier.pdf)

There will be two parallel full day pre-conference workshops at [2018 SACNAS](http://www.2018sacnas.org/) that will introduce participants to best practices, tools, and platforms for doing data-intensive research.

1. **[Software and Data Carpentry](#workshop-1-software-and-data-carpentry)**
1. **[Data Platforms for Life Science Researchers](#workshop-2-data-platforms-for-life-science-researchers)**

Together, [CyVerse](http://www.cyverse.org/), [Galaxy](https://galaxyproject.org/), [Software Carpentry](http://www.software-carpentry.org/), and [Data Carpentry](http://www.datacarpentry.org/) will introduce participants to best practices, tools, and platforms for data-intensive research in two parallel workshops at the SACNAS pre-conference workshops. Workshops are for any researcher who has data they want to analyze, and no prior computational experience is required.

These hands-on workshops teach basic concepts, skills and tools for working more effectively with data. Attendees will learn the best practices for data organization and analysis using the command line and Python (Software and Data Carpentry workshop) or working with data-analysis platforms to manage, integrate, analyze, and visualize your data (Data Platforms for Life Science Researchers).

# Registration

[Registration](https://sacnas-data.eventbrite.com/) is *free* but space is limited.  You are strongly encouraged to register soon.

# Travel Scholarships

The Galaxy Community Fund is augmenting [SACNAS Travel Scholarships awards](http://www.2018sacnas.org/events/2018-sacnas-the-national-diversity-in-stem-conference/custom-167-56b6a0f11ab04eec9c1b886e6cd0c33d.aspx) for the first ~ 28 scholarship recipients that register for these workshops. The additional funds will cover an extra night's lodging for scholarship recipients, enabling you to arrive the day before the workshops.  Space is limited, and once the funds are allocated, they are gone. [Register Now](https://sacnas-data.eventbrite.com/)

**Wednesday, October 10, 9am- 6pm**

**Room 303 B**

Ever find yourself manually repeating coding tasks?  Do you feel like there should be an easier way to go about doing data analysis and visualization?  Join us for a [Software](https://software-carpentry.org/) and [Data Carpentry](http://www.datacarpentry.org/) session to learn how to

1. efficiently work in the unix shell for file manipulation and
1.  use Python in a sample workflow of data analysis from loading to visualization.

Bring your laptop for a series of hands-on exercises.

**Wednesday, October 10, 9am- 6pm**

**Room 303 C**

Want to do data analysis and don’t know where to start?  [CyVerse](http://www.cyverse.org/) and [Galaxy](https://galaxyproject.org/)  are two widely used and freely available data analysis platforms for life science research.  This workshop will cover both platforms and by the end of the day you’ll know how to use both to manage, integrate, analyze, and visualize your data.  The focus will be on interactive hands-on exercises with life science data.  Bring your laptop and your curiosity.
