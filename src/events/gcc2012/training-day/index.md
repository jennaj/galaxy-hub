# Workshops

## Prerequisites

These workshops are hands-on whenever possible.  Since they are hands-on, they have prerequisites.  If you don't meet the prerequisites, then you won't get much out of the workshop.  If you don't have the prerequisites for most of the workshops, then you won't get much out of the day.  Our goal is that when you walk out of a workshop, you will have some actual experience with the workshop topic.  **Please read the prerequisites for workshops before deciding if you should attend.**

### Prerequisites for all workshops

1. A wifi enabled laptop, or a buddy with such a laptop who will let you sit and work with them.

### Suggested Prerequisites for Workshops Requiring a Running Galaxy Instance

These workshops require a running Galaxy instance that you have root/admin access to:

* [WS1: Integrating Tools & Data Sources](#ws1)
* [WS6: Galaxy API](#ws6)
* [WS7: Galaxy Tool Shed](#ws7)

While you can use any running Galaxy instance, **we strongly recommend that you use the [conference provided virtual machine image](/src/events/gcc2012/training-day/vms/index.md), and that you have it installed and running before arriving at the conference.**

See the [Virtual Machine page](](/src/events/gcc2012/training-day/vms/index.md)) for instructions on how to do this.

## WS7

| Title | WS7: Galaxy Tool Shed |
| :----: | ---- |
| **Instructors** | Greg von Kuster & Nate Coraor; Penn State University |
| **Content** | The Galaxy tool shed is a place for the Galaxy community to share functionally correct Galaxy tools, proprietary Galaxy data types and exported Galaxy workflows. Tools in the tool shed should have been built within a proprietary development environment that included a local Galaxy instance in which they were proven to be functionally correct before they were uploaded to the tool shed. Demonstrating the use of the tool shed excludes discussions about developing the tools, proprietary datatypes or workflows that are stored there. |
| **Prerequisites** | A general knowledge of Galaxy, or attendance at Workshop 2 <br />Administrative access to a Galaxy instance that was: <br > • Installed by you prior to the training day. <br /> • Setup by you during Workshop 5 using the virtual machine image for Workshop 5.<br /> • Installed by you prior to arriving at the conference, using the virtual machine image that has a running Galaxy.<br />We strongly recommend that you use the conference provided virtual machine image and have it installed and running before arriving at the conference. If you use something other than a conference-provided virtual machine (VM) instance, you'll be responsible for handling issues that are outside of Galaxy.<br />Knowledge and comfort with the Unix/Linux command line interface and a text editor. If you don't know what cd, mv, rm, mkdir, chmod, grep and so on can do then you will struggle in this workshop.<br />Basic understanding of the process for developing a simple Galaxy tool as well as Galaxy data types, or attendance at Workshop 1. |
| **Results** | Starting up your own local tool shed in addition to your own local Galaxy instance. You will be interacting between these two applications throughout the workshop. Uploading one or more custom tools to your local tool shed, creating a tool shed repository. Installing repositories containing tools and custom datatypes from your local tool shed into your local Galaxy instance. Installing a repository that contains a workflow into your local Galaxy instance, and then import the workflow from the repository. Deactivating and reactivating installed repositories that contain custom datatypes and tools. Uninstalling and reinstalling installed repositories that contain custom datatypes and tools. Getting updates in your local Galaxy instance for installed repositories. Understanding of Galaxy tool versions and how they relate to tools contained in installed repositories. Discussion of tools being migrated from the Galaxy distribution to the tool shed. |

## WS8

| Title | WS8: Variant and SNP Analysis with Galaxy |
| :----: | ---- |
| **Instructors** | Erik Garrison, Boston College |
| **Content** | Participants in this workshop will use simulation to develop familiarity with the performance of basic SNP and indel detection methods. <br />By comparing variant detection results under different conditions to the known set of true variants produced by the simulation, participants will assess the effects of standard practices such as base quality recalibration, indel realignment, and variant quality filters. |
| **Prerequisites** | A general knowledge of Galaxy, or attendance at Workshop 2 |
| **Results** | You will be able to use simulation to determine optimal small variant detection methods and selection criteria for a given experimental design. |

## WS10

| Title | WS10: Ion Torrent – Open Source Sequencing |
| :----: | ---- |
| **Instructors** | Matt Dyer, Associate Director, Ion Torrent, Bioinformatics & Community |
| **Content** | Torrent Suite Software is an open source platform that automates the analysis of data streaming from the Ion Torrent Personal Genome Machine and Proton Sequencers. Torrent Suite provides an intuitive web interface and a flexible Software Development Kit (SDK) that enables users to develop plugins which quickly and easily expand the analysis capabilities of Torrent Suite Software. The SDK includes a powerful API that for interacting directly with the system.
