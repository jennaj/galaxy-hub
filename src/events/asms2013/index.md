Galaxy is going to have a good presence (one workshop and many posters) at the [61st ASMS Conference on Mass Spectrometry and Allied Topics](http://www.asms.org/conferences/annual-conference).



## Workshop: The Galaxy Framework as a Solution for MS-based Informatics

Tuesday evening (June 11th 5:45 - 7:00 PM) there is a workshop titled "[The Galaxy Framework as a Solution for MS-based Informatics](http://www.asms.org/docs/conference/workshops-on-tuesday.pdf?sfvrsn=2)."

<div class='indent'>

"The open source, community-developed, web-based Galaxy framework enables sharing of software and analysis workflows, promoting increased transparency in data analysis and adherence to standards. Originally designed for the genomics research community, Galaxy is gaining use by those in the MS-based proteomics and metabolomics
community where new informatics solutions are urgently needed.  Galaxy usage is driven by its unique and powerful features, not offered by other current solutions.  This workshop seeks to inform current users of Galaxy on the newest developments, and introduce the framework to interested  new users. Top developers of Galaxy for MS-based
informatics will give short informal presentations on their work, followed by a panel discussion and an open question and answer period from the audience."

wiki comment:
> **Note:** The workshop features a broad spectrum of the Galaxy community that is interested in proteomics:
> * Minnesota participants will talk about [Galaxy-P](http://getgalaxyp.org/)
> * An [NBIC](http://nbic.nl) representative
> * [Ira Cooke](/src/events/gcc2012/abstracts/index.md#proteomics-tools-for-galaxy) of La Trobe University
> * A member of the [Science For Life Laboratory](http://www.scilifelab.se/) will talk about Adapt, a cloud-based proteomics platform implemented on top of Galaxy.
