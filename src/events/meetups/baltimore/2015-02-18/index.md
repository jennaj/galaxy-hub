## There's a meetup - again!

Hey Everyone,

We are looking forward to a [follow-up Meetup](https://wiki.galaxyproject.org/Events/Meetups/Baltimore/2015-01-22) by the [Galaxy Project](http://galaxyproject.org)! We will meet at one of the Galaxy project hubs - the Department of Biology of Johns Hopkins University. This time around, we will briefly take a look at how to get started using Galaxy. Again, this will be an informal meeting open to anyone interested in data analysis, tools, computer infrastructure, programming.

[Enis Afgan](/src/people/enis-afgan/index.md) and [Nitesh Turaga](/src/people/nitesh-turaga/index.md) of the [Galaxy team](/src/galaxy-team/index.md) will be delivering a short introduction to the resources available to start using the Galaxy application from a practitioner's viewpoint (and will be available for any additional questions). 

Thanks and hope to see you there!

#### What is Galaxy and why could it be interesting to me?

Galaxy is a web-based, open source, data integration and analysis platform for life science research. The core pillars of the application are:
* **Accessibility**: enable bench scientists to create bioinformatics analyses
* **Reproducibility**: facilitate computational methods to be completely easily reproducible
* **Transparency**: enable easy sharing and publishing of research data and analyses

A sample instance of the application that is free to use is available at [usegalaxy.org](https://usegalaxy.org/).
Although focused around Galaxy, this meetup is open to anyone interested in the above topics without their specific ties to the application.
