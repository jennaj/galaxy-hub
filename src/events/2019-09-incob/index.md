Galaxy, and especially the [Galaxy Australia community](https://www.embl-abr.org.au/galaxyaustralia/) will have a strong presence at [INCOB 2019](http://incob2019.org/) in Jakarta.  There will be an [Introduction to Galaxy workshop](http://incob2019.org/workshop2/) and a conference talk about the Galaxy Australia platform.  In addition, we will be holding a breakout session on Thursday morning about *[Building a regional Galaxy Community and Platform](http://incob2019.org/breakout-session/)*.

## Building a regional Galaxy Community and Platform

**Breakout Session, Thursday, 11:00-12:00**

This [breakout's](http://incob2019.org/breakout-session/) goal is to kickstart the building regional Galaxy communities and platforms in Asia and Oceania.  This breakout will describe existing regional Galaxy communities and platforms, and hopefully start to create them in this part of the world.

Several regional communities and resources already exist in the Galaxy ecosystem. [Galaxy Australia](https://usegalaxy.org,au/) operates a nationally distributed federation of compute resources, where individual researcher analysis requests are assigned according to a sophisticated rules system optimised for rapid result generation.  [Galaxy Europe](https://galaxyproject.eu/) operates an international infrastructure to support the research needs of life scientists in Europe.  Other efforts (such as Galaxy Africa) are in the works.  These efforts also serve as community hubs for their regions.

This breakout features three short talks to introduce the Galaxy regional community landscape:

* [Global Galaxy communities and services](https://depot.galaxyproject.org/hub/attachments/events/2019-09-incob/global-galaxy-communities.pdf), [Dave Clements](/src/people/dave-clements/index.md), Galaxy Project, [Johns Hopkins University](https://jhu.edu/)
* [Galaxy Australia as a usegalaxy.* public service](https://depot.galaxyproject.org/hub/attachments/events/2019-09-incob/galaxy-australia-open.pdf), [Gareth Price](https://qfab.org/team-member/dr-gareth-price), Galaxy Australia, [QFAB Bioinformatics](https://qfab.org/), Brisbane
* [Future Galaxy developments for distributed data access](https://depot.galaxyproject.org/hub/attachments/events/2019-09-incob/future-galaxy-developments-for-distributed-data-access.pdf), [Nuwan Goonesekera](https://www.melbournebioinformatics.org.au/people/nuwan-goonasekera/), Galaxy Australia, [University of Melbourne](https://www.unimelb.edu.au/)

This will be followed by a moderated discussion on the benefits of growing a Galaxy service to support a greater number and diversity of researchers regionally. Topics covered will include but are not limited to:

* What could a regional service look like?
* The benefits for contributing institute / organisation
* How does each institute control access to resources
* Can staff time be contributed as well as or instead of computer infrastructure
* What is the sustainability model
* Regional branding on the Galaxy service

The session will conclude with a commitment to grow a community of interested parties and agree on a time frame to resourcing the regional Galaxy service.

**About Galaxy** <br />
Galaxy is a widely used and deployed open-source platform that integrates thousands of analysis tools, and supports data integration and analysis, workflow creation, data visualization, and sharing and publishing your analyses and pipelines. Galaxy is also *a global community* of researchers, programmers, trainers, and users all doing and supporting data intensive research.

Interested? Then we hope to see you at INCOB.<br />
