Are you a life scientist who needs to do complex analysis on large datasets?

Galaxy is an open, web-based platform for data intensive life science research that enables non-bioinformaticians to create, run, tune, and share their own bioinformatic analyses.

Most of the workshop will be hands-on and teach participants how to integrate data, and perform simple and complex analysis within Galaxy.  It will also cover data visualization and visual analytics, and how to share and reuse your bioinformatic analyses, all from within Galaxy.

No programming or Linux command line experience is required.  A basic knowledge of molecular biology is assumed.
