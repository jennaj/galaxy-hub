This workshop will cover the concepts of de novo assembly and initial annotation of a genome from short-read NGS data. You will be introduced to the widely-used de novo assembly pipeline, including quality checking, trimming, concepts of filtering, concepts of annotation and use a selection of tools to identify genomic features of interest.
