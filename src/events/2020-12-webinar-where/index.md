There are *many* ways that researchers can access Galaxy.  This webinar will introduce participants to a range of options for using Galaxy instances around the world, and on your own laptop too.

In one hour (or less !) this webinar will cover:

* Publicly accessible Galaxy servers on the web (there are over 100 of them)
* Research and commercial cloud platforms, from Australia (Nectar) to the US (Jetstream, AnVIL), and everywhere in between (CloudLaunch) 
* On your laptop, using pre-packaged containers and virtual machines.
