The Galaxy Training Network is organizing every 3 months one day dedicated to the training community: collaborative work on the training content but also calls with the community.

**The next day will be on the 21st of November.** Anyone who would like to contribute, learn how to contribute to the Galaxy Training Material or just catch up with the community is very welcome to join.

During the day, we will have **2 GTN community calls** to share news about Galaxy and Training, and also just chat together.
To accommodate different time zones and schedules, there will be 2 calls (with similar discussions) at [8am (UTC + 2)](https://arewemeetingyet.com/Berlin/2019-11-21/08:00/GTN%20meeting) and [4pm (UTC + 2)](https://arewemeetingyet.com/Berlin/2019-11-21/16:00/GTN%20meeting) via [Hangout](https://hangouts.google.com/hangouts/_/calendar/Z2FsYXh5dW5pZnJlaWJ1cmdAZ21haWwuY29t.6nungcj20l9qh2uicb8h5ivpds).

Outside of these calls, we will have a **CoFest (Collaboration Fest)**. We will coordinate via [Hangout](https://hangouts.google.com/hangouts/_/calendar/Z2FsYXh5dW5pZnJlaWJ1cmdAZ21haWwuY29t.6nungcj20l9qh2uicb8h5ivpds) (drop-in channel we will keep open the whole day) and [the GTN Gitter channel](https://gitter.im/Galaxy-Training-Network/Lobby).
