**NGS Analysis and Workflows using Galaxy**

This hands-on Galaxy workshop will cover several common analysis pathways with an emphasis on maximising basic and intermediate level functions of the Galaxy application for reproducible, publication quality, scientific research.

### Suggested Prerequisites

While the workshop will be useful and informative for new Galaxy users, attendees will get the most out of the hands-on exercises if they have some basic familiarity with using Galaxy.
* The first thing you should try: [Galaxy 101](https://usegalaxy.org/u/aun1/p/galaxy101)
* Review a set of introductory-level tutorials: [Using Galaxy](https://usegalaxy.org/u/galaxyproject/p/using-galaxy-2012)
* Get involved with the Galaxy Scientific user community by joining in on the conversations at [Galaxy Biostars](https://biostar.usegalaxy.org) (which has now moved to [help.galaxyproject.org](https://help.galaxyproject.org/)
* Resources: [Learn](/src/learn/index.md) and [Support](/src/support/index.md)

#### What is Galaxy and why could it be interesting to me?

Galaxy is a web-based, open source, data integration and analysis platform for life science research. The core pillars of the application are:
* **Accessibility**: enable bench scientists to create bioinformatics analyses
* **Reproducibility**: facilitate computational methods to be completely easily reproducible
* **Transparency**: enable easy sharing and publishing of research data and analyses

A sample instance of the application that is free to use is available at: [usegalaxy.org](https://usegalaxy.org/)
