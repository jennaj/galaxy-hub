The 2014 Galaxy Community Conference (GCC2014) was held at the [Homewood Campus](http://webapps.jhu.edu/jhuniverse/information_about_hopkins/campuses/homewood_campus/) of [Johns Hopkins University](http://jhu.edu), in [Baltimore, Maryland](http://visitors.baltimorecity.gov/), United States, from June 30 through July 2, 2014

[Galaxy Community Conferences](/src/gcc/index.md) are an opportunity to participate in [presentations](/src/events/gcc2014/abstracts/index.md#talk-abstracts), discussions, [poster sessions](/src/events/gcc2014/abstracts/index.md#poster-abstracts), [lightning talks](/src/events/gcc2014/lightning/index.md) and [birds-of-a-feather gatherings](/src/events/gcc2014/bofs/index.md), all about high-throughput biology and the tools that support it.  

The conference also included a [Training Day](/src/events/gcc2014/training-day/index.md) offering in-depth topic coverage, across several concurrent sessions.

## Who will be there?

* **Researchers with more data than can fit into a spreadsheet**
    Galaxy enables bench scientists to do complex bioinformatic analysis that scale to the volume of data being generated with current and upcoming sequencing instruments.  Learn how to exploit your data.

* **Workflow developers and power bioinformatics users**
    Use Galaxy to construct complex bioinformatics workflows and then run them repeatedly, share them with others, or publish them to the world.

* **Sequencing and Bioinformatics core staff**
    Local Galaxy deployments can talk directly with your sequencers, simplify your analysis tasks, and give your researchers direct access to running their own custom analysis. 

* **Bioinformatics tool developers and data providers**
    Integrate your tools and resources in the Galaxy framework, increasing their visibility, and making them easier to use and integrate with other resources. 

* **Data and analysis archival specialists**
    Galaxy is being used to extend the goal of reproducibility from the wet lab to the computational realm by persisting datasets and the computational analyses that produced them. 

## You should attend to ...

* **[Present your work!](/src/events/gcc2014/abstracts/index.md)**
* **[Learn best practices](/src/events/gcc2014/program/index.md)** for deploying Galaxy, defining and installing resources, and managing and moving large datasets.
* **Network with others** in the Galaxy community who are facing similar challenges and using Galaxy and other tools to address them.
* Learn what the Galaxy Project's plans are, and **contribute to Galaxy's future direction.**
* **Learn** 
  * how to visualize your data in Galaxy and use visualization to guide your analysis (visual analytics)
  * how to share, publish, and reuse your analyses with Galaxy
  * how to perform *and enable your users to perform* common, yet complex, analyses using Galaxy
* when and how to use *Galaxy on the Cloud*

## Keynote Speaker

We are pleased to announce that [Steven Salzberg](http://ccb.jhu.edu/people/salzberg/) will be the keynote speaker at GCC2014.  Steven is a Professor of Medicine, [Biostatistics](http://www.biostat.jhsph.edu/), and [Computer Science](http://www.cs.jhu.edu/) at the [Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine](http://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/som/) where he is also Director of the [Center for Computational Biology](http://ccb.jhu.edu/) at the [McKusick-Nathans Institute of Genetic Medicine](http://igm.jhmi.edu/).  Steven has made many prominent contributions to open source software, including several of the most popular tools used on Galaxy Platforms.  Recently he was awarded the  [2013 Benjamin Franklin Award for Open Access in the Life Sciences](http://www.bioinformatics.org/forums/forum.php?forum_id=10206), and the [2012 Balles Prize in Critical Thinking](http://www.csicop.org/news/show/skeptic_authors_steven_salzberg_and_joe_nickell_to_receive_balles_prize) for his [science column](http://www.forbes.com/sites/stevensalzberg/) at [Forbes](http://www.forbes.com/).

Steve's GCC2014 talk will be on "Transcriptomes and Exomes: Computational Challenges of NGS Data."  

## About Galaxy

Galaxy makes it easy to perform analysis interactively through the web, on arbitrarily large datasets. With hundreds of tools there are few limits on what can be done. Now with NGS tools & workflows for short-read mapping, ChIP-seq, RNA-seq, metagenomics, and pileup analysis, trackster browser, collaborative pages, and support for Galaxy in the Cloud. Galaxy is distributed under the [Academic Free License](/src/admin/license/index.md).
