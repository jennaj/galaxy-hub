This workshop will cover the concepts of detection small variants, including SNPs and small indels, from next-generation sequencing data. You will use and compare a number of popular variant detection tools, visualise variants using a genome browser, and annotate SNPs for predicted biological effects.

The workshop will all be based in Galaxy, a platform that provides a simple and user-friendly interface to bioinformatics tools.
