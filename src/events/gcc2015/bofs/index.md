There is no better place than a Galaxy Community Conference to meet and learn from others doing data-intensive biology.  [GCC2015](http://gcc2015.tsl.ac.uk/) will continue this tradition by again including *[Birds of a Feather (BoF)](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birds_of_a_feather_(computing))* meetups.  Birds of a Feather meetups are informal gatherings where participants group together based on common interests.

BoF meetups are encouraged throughout GCC2015.  We particularly want to encourage BoFs that flock at the end of each day, when time and space have been allocated for them.

## BoF Support

The conference *enables and encourages* BoFs by

* Encouraging conference participants to organize BoFs
* Use this wiki page as a hub for BoFs at [GCC2015](http://gcc2015.tsl.ac.uk/).
* Promote BoFs to all conference participants, over and over, both before and during the conference.
* Coordinate and reserve rooms for BoFs, and allocate time in the schedule for them too.
