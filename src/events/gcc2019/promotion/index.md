**GCC2019 will be held in Freiburg, Germany, 1-6 July.**  Like [previous Galaxy Community Conferences](/src/gcc/index.md), GCC2019 will feature invited keynotes, accepted talks, posters, and demos, birds-of-a-feather gatherings, multiple days of collaborative work, and plenty of opportunities to network with your fellow data-intensive researchers and practitioners.  If you are working in data-intensive life science, there is no better place to be.
