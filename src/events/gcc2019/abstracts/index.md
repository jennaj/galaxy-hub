You can submit the same abstract as a long talk, a lightning talk, a poster and a demo.  (You can also submit separate abstracts if you want the wording to be different.) If you check both "Oral Presentation" and "Lightning Talk" then your abstract will first be considered for a long talk, and then for a lightning talk only if it is not selected as a long talk. If you submit both "Poster Presentation" and "Software Demo" and both are accepted, then your poster and demo will be presented concurrently and adjacent to each other.

**Please use the [GCC2019 Abstract Template](https://depot.galaxyproject.org/hub/attachments/events/gcc2019/abstracts/gcc2019-abstract-template.docx) to format your abstract.**
