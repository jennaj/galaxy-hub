Every 3 months the Galaxy Training Network organises one day dedicated to the community! **May the 28th is the next community day** and here's what's going on:

# CoFest

This CoFest's topic is: **Online Training & BCC2020 Workshop materials**
Due to COVID-19, a lot of training activities are moving online. We would love to hear everybody's experiences with this. Furthermore, The [Bioinformatics Community Conference](https://bcc2020.github.io/), is going fully online this year, with a [strong Galaxy training program](https://bcc2020.sched.com/overview/subject/Training), scheduled across in multiple time zones. We invite anybody to help us test and update the materials needed for this online conference. As always, if you already have something else in mind you would like to work on during the CoFest we are more than happy to help in any way we can as well!


Anyone who would like to contribute, learn how to contribute to the Galaxy Training Material or just catch up with the community is very welcome to join.

We will coordinate via [Hangout](https://hangouts.google.com/hangouts/_/calendar/Z2FsYXh5dW5pZnJlaWJ1cmdAZ21haWwuY29t.6n6fbpoqj6s81h9aokvtim69id) (drop-in channel we will keep open the whole day) and the [GTN Gitter channel](https://gitter.im/Galaxy-Training-Network/Lobby).

# GTN Call

The idea of these meetings is to share news about Galaxy and Training, but also just talk together. *Everyone is welcome to join!*

To accommodate different time zones and schedules, there will be 2 calls (with similar discussions) at [8am (UTC + 2)](https://arewemeetingyet.com/Berlin/2020-05-28/08:00/GTN%20meeting) and [4pm (UTC + 2)](https://arewemeetingyet.com/Berlin/2020-05-28/16:00/GTN%20meeting) via [Hangout](https://hangouts.google.com/hangouts/_/calendar/Z2FsYXh5dW5pZnJlaWJ1cmdAZ21haWwuY29t.6n6fbpoqj6s81h9aokvtim69id).

Agenda and minutes document in [this Google Doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1BA4TYe5snFd5866ZeF3OtuV9quhpvvfrIMn6qD2qxl0/edit?usp=sharing), please feel free to suggest your agenda items here if there is anything you would like to discuss or learn about!
