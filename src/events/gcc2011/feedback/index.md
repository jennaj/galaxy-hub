## And a sampling of other comments in the feedback:

* I'm looking at setting up a new Galaxy instance for my research organisation and this conference answered all my questions and more about how best to go about this.
* Really nice conference, nice people
* It was awesome to meet the actual team behind all this and approach them directly with questions.
* One big realization was the fact that we're all having the same issues on the biomedical field, it's good to share those insights.
* I think the format was perfect. A good series of talks, lighting talks, and some nice discussion in the break out group.
* The meeting was well orginized!
* Just keeping on doing what you just did!
* It was just awesome :) Keep the great work guys !
* Thanks for all the good work, both the conference organization and galaxy itself! Keep on.
* The organisation was excellent!
* Conference was very well organization.  Its amazing to see participation from so many organizations.
* Fantastic venue, relaxed atmosphere, fantastic organisation and great to interact with the community as a whole. 
* I also found that the frequent opportunities to interact with other Galaxy users and developers very useful, and which was helped by having everything on the single site.
* The relaxed atmosphere encouraged interaction and discussion.
* The community aspect was most useful; the chance to talk to the devs and to other people in a similar situation to our institution.
* Good sense of community and the desire to help each other out.

And my two favorites:

* Graag gedaan!
* Avoid volcanic eruptions
