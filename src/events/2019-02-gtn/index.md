The Galaxy Training Network has developed an infrastructure to deliver interactive training based on Galaxy: one central place (https://training.galaxyproject.org) to aggregate training materials covering many current research topics. Each topic is supported by different tutorials developed and maintained by the community via a GitHub repository: https://github.com/galaxyproject/training-material.

The Galaxy Training Network is organizing regular online CoFests (Collaboration/Contribution Fests) every 3 months on the 3rd Thursday for a day of the collaborative work on the training content.

**The next one will be on the 21st of February.** Anyone who would like to contribute on any other topics is very welcome to join.
We will coordinate via [Hangout](https://hangouts.google.com/hangouts/_/calendar/Z2FsYXh5dW5pZnJlaWJ1cmdAZ21haWwuY29t.7q82sbcupg0j59li0fqo9pots6) (drop-in channel we will keep open the whole day) and [the GTN Gitter channel](https://gitter.im/Galaxy-Training-Network/Lobby).

During the day, we plan to have **GTN community calls** to discuss the recent changes and future directions. To accommodate different time zones and schedules, we will have 2 calls (with similar discussions) at [8am (UTC + 1)](http://arewemeetingyet.com/Berlin/2019-02-21/08:00/GTN%20meeting) and [4pm (UTC + 1)](http://arewemeetingyet.com/Berlin/2019-02-21/16:00/GTN%20meeting) via [Hangout](https://hangouts.google.com/hangouts/_/calendar/Z2FsYXh5dW5pZnJlaWJ1cmdAZ21haWwuY29t.7q82sbcupg0j59li0fqo9pots6).
