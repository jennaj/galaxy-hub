The Galaxy Community and Bioinformatics Open Source Conference aimed to make events accessible to parents. We encouraged people to bring their kids and to please take advantage of the services that GCCBOSC offered.

Support was offered for everyone from nursing infants though 12 year olds and was quite successful.  One of the keynote speakers was able to attend and present because of the availability of childcare, and another speaker presented her talk with her 4 month old asleep on her chest.

## Infants and Nursing Parents

If you have an infant and you want to have them with you during the day, then please bring them along.  The conference will provide a nearby room each day for nursing parents.  Please let us know so we can plan.

**[Register your interest in a nursing room](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfBj9iscgZaX5iC5UG3yoZjZMWvsE3pe98qRe4gbn44S_UXjw/viewform)**

***Note: Registration for childcare closed Friday, June 8.*** You can still sign up for the nursing room.

Subsidized childcare *([thank you eLife and ISB](/src/events/gccbosc2018/childcare/index.md#support-from-elife-and-isb)!)*  for kids ages 6 weeks to 12 years of age is provided by [Little Vikings](http://www.littlevikings.org/) child care in the [Smith Memorial Student Union](https://www.pdx.edu/student-union/) on the [Portland State University](https://www.pdx.edu/) campus in downtown Portland. Little Vikings' goal is to provide a safe, comfortable, joyful experience.

* Lunch, snacks and beverages are provided for kids between 3 and 12.
* We ask that parents bring pre-made bottles, and baby food and snacks for your infants and toddlers.

Little Vikings is a Nut Free Facility.

**Childcare is available from 8am to 7pm, Monday-Saturday, June 25<sup>th</sup> - June 30<sup>th</sup>.**  Each day's core conference activities start at 9 and end by 6, giving you time to get kids settled, and to pick them up. If you want to attend evening sessions such as birds-of-a-feather or the conference dinner then *you are encouraged to bring your kids along to the evening sessions.* Evening sessions and the conference dinner tend to be informal events and having kids around contributes to that vibe.

Space is extremely limited.

## Location and Lodging

**Reed College has a strict no-minors policy in their dorms.**  Therefore, you'll need to find alternative housing.  PSU is in downtown Portland and GCCBOSC is at Reed College which is several miles outside of downtown. If you are using Little Vikings childcare, it may make sense to stay close to PSU. See the conference FAQ page for some nearby options.

These options are particularly close to Portland State:

* [Heathman Hotel](http://portland.heathmanhotel.com/), 1001 SW Broadway, 12 minute walk
* [Paramount Hotel](http://www.portlandparamount.com/), 808 SW Taylor, 12 minute walk

There are several other options within a 15 minute walk:

* [University Place Hotel](https://www.pdx.edu/university-place/), 310 SW Lincoln St, 14 minute walk (Portland State's own hotel, **use code STAYPDX**)
* [Hotel Modera](https://www.hotelmodera.com/)
* [Duniway Hotel](http://www3.hilton.com/en/hotels/oregon/the-duniway-portland-a-hilton-hotel-PDXTPHH/index.html), 545 SW Taylor, 

Reed College also has a [list of recommended hotels](https://www.reed.edu/accommodations.html), including [several that are downtown](https://www.reed.edu/accommodations.html#downtown).
