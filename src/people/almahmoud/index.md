# Alexandru Mahmoud

I joined the Galaxy Team in June 2018 when I started working in [James Taylor's Lab](http://taylorlab.org/) at Johns Hopkins University. The focus of my work for the first year was in the area of cloud computing. I started by focusing on our multi-cloud infrastructure by contributing to CloudBridge and CloudLaunch, particularly working on integrating Azure. I then started working on deploying Galaxy on Kubernetes, and particularly contributed to the Galaxy Helm Chart and developed a CVMFS-CSI Helm Chart in order to leverage the capabilities of CERN's CVMFS in a Kubernetes context.

I was first introduced to Galaxy through the [LAPPSGrid project](http://www.lappsgrid.org/) during my undergraduate years at Vassar College where I worked as a Research Assistant with Professor Nancy Ide.
