# Recommendations for GCC2016 Participants

In addition to being on the GCC2016 Exec, Carrie also lives in Bloomington and has these recommendations for those of us that don't:

## Where to eat

Btown has a wide selection of dining options and prices. My recommendations are my own:

* Taste of India - my favorite place for Indian food. A little pricy, but the butter chicken is awesome. Seats 20.
* Turkuaz - Turkish/Mediteranean food of good quality and medium price range. The veggie kabobs are my favorite but the lamb chops and pides are also great. Seats 15.
* Casa Brava - Near College Mall on the 9 or 3 bus. Seats 30. Great food that is reasonably priced. This is my favorite Mexican place.
* Uptown Cafe - Creole and Americana. Great atmosphere, medium price range. Seats 30. One of my favorite places.
* Monet and Farm - upscale places. Farm is hit or miss. Monet is usually great but very pricy.
* Chocolate Moose - Bloomington institution. Long lines but decent ice cream. It's a little hut in a parking lot.
* Siam House - service isn't the best, but decent Thai food.
* Little Tibet - good food, medium prices. A Bloomington institution.
* Jankos - Bloomington institution. I don't recommend this place - prices are outrageous. Steakhouse, Americana. Seats 20.

## Bars

* Nicks - Bloomington institution. Play Sink the Biz if you are brave. Great bar for hanging out and conversation, with nooks and crannies that aren't too loud. 
* Yogis - Cheap, food is ok. Great selection on draft.
* The Tap - Loud. Great selection on draft. Seats 20.
* Crazy Horse - Loud, fun, lots of options. Seats 25.
* Kilroys on Kirkwood and Kilroys Sports bar - loud, but can have good drink specials. Serve food. Seats 100. Cheap wings on Monday!
* The Irish Lion - Decent Irish food and a good bar. Pub grub is reasonably priced and fancy items are also available. Seats 50.

## Wine

* Butler Tasting Room - This is one of my favorite places - it's in a quaint building on Walnut just north of the railroad. It's "walkable" for the sturdy of constitution from campus.
* Oliver Winery - The winery is just North of Bloomington and has a beautiful grounds. They close at 6 most nights, 8 on Saturday.

## Shops

* Game Preserve - if you like board games and RPGs, this is for you. On the Bloomington Square.
* Vintage Phoenix - comic book shop on 6th St close to Walnut St.
* Caveat Emptor - a fun bookshop which is pretty much a fixture in Bloomington.
* Landlocked Music - if you need to take some vinyls home with you, peruse this store.

## Hiking

I love to hike; my favorite places are Griffy Lake, the Deam Wilderness, and the Beanblossom Bottoms. 

* [Griffy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Griffy_Lake) is close to Bloomington and has nice trails and a tranquil lake to watch birds or fish.
* [Deam Wilderness](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_C._Deam_Wilderness_Area) is about 45 minutes from campus, but a beautiful place for those who like to be lost in forests.
* [Beanblossom Bottoms](https://sycamorelandtrust.org/beanblossom-bottoms) is a neat experience for seeing how much of Indiana existed before settlement - swamp and wetlands. The boardwalk keeps you up out of the water, but at this time of year you want some bug repellent.
