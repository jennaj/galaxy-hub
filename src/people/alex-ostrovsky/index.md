# Alex Ostrovsky

I began working with the Galaxy team in April 2019 with [James Taylor's Lab](http://taylorlab.org/) at John's Hopkins. As I work with Galaxy, I am also completing my master's degree in Bioinformatics at the [University of Oregon](https://bioinformatics.uoregon.edu/). My work with Galaxy involves wrapping and developing of tools, especially in the area of single-cell sequencing.

Before Galaxy, I worked as a Research Assistant in the [Remington lab](http://molbio.uoregon.edu/remington/), the [Postlethwait lab](https://ion.uoregon.edu/content/john-postlethwait), and the [Smear lab](https://ion.uoregon.edu/content/matt-smear) at the University of Oregon.
