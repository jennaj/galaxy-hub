A [GalaxyCzars](/src/community/galaxy-admins/index.md) breakout session was held at [GCC2012](/src/events/gcc2012/index.md). This was an opportunity for this group to meet face-to-face for the first time. GalaxyCzars is about installing, configuring, and maintaining large Galaxy installations. It was open to anyone.

* We need a new name! 
  :: We tried to brainstorm a new name for the group... being that it was Friday afternoon this was a difficult task!  We will keep looking for a new name.  Some suggestions:  GalaxyLocals, GalaxyCommons, etc.

* Talked about goals for the group
  :: Can we as a collective community build a set of common topologies? Can we find common problems?  

* Talked about problems that a lot of us have:
  :: A common problem across the group was how to tune tools for the cluster.  IE set the number of threads, min/max heap
