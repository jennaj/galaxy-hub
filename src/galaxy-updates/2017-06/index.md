Welcome to the June 2017 *[Galactic News](/src/galaxy-updates/index.md)*, a summary of what is going on in the Galaxy community.  If you have anything to add to next month's newsletter, then please send it to outreach@galaxyproject.org.


# GCC2017 is almost here!

<div class="right"><a href="https://gcc2017.sciencesconf.org/"><img src="/src/images/logos/gcc2017-logo-300.png" alt='2017 Galaxy Community Conference (GCC2017)' width="220" /></a></div>

GCC2017 will be in Montpellier, France, 26-30 June and will feature two days of presentations, discussions, poster sessions, lightning talks, computer demos, keynotes, and birds-of-a-feather meetups, **all about data-intensive biology and the tools and infrastructure that support it.** GCC2017 also includes data and coding hacks, and **[two days of training](https://gcc2017.sched.com/overview/type/Training)** covering 16 different topics.
 
GCC2017 will be held at [Le Corum Conference Centre](http://www.montpellier-events.com/en/The-Corum/Presentation) in the heart of [Montpellier](https://gcc2017.sciencesconf.org/page/location), just 10km from the Mediterranean. This event will gather several hundred researchers addressing diverse questions and facing common challenges in data intensive life science research. GCC participants work across the tree of life, come from around the world, and work at universities, research organizations, industry, medical schools and research hospitals.

## Regular Registration Rates Extended to June 16

If you missed the May 31 regular registration deadline then don't worry because it has been extended to June 16.  **[Regular registration](https://gcc2017.sciencesconf.org/page/registration)** starts at 75â‚¬ / day for post-docs and students.  You can also [book low cost conference housing](https://gcc2017.sciencesconf.org/page/lodging) when you register.

## Keynotes

### Eytan Domany

**Personalized Analysis of  Cancer Data: From Genes to Pathways (and Back)**

[Dr. Eytan Domany](http://www.weizmann.ac.il/complex/compphys/) will cover his work in human genomics and computational biology principally in the cancer domain. Eytan Domany is a Professor of Computational Systems Biology in the Department of Physics and Complex Systems at the [Weizmann Institute of Science](http://www.weizmann.ac.il/) in Rehovot, Israel. The main focus of his group is to mine data from large-scale experiments in biology. The work includes development of mathematical methods, their implementation in algorithms (which are incorporated in user-friendly computational tools), which are then applied to study biological data. Eytan was awarded the [Sergio Lombroso Award in Cancer Research](http://www.weizmann.ac.il/pages/prof-eytan-domany) in 2016 for his research efforts.

 
### Anton Nekrutenko & James Taylor

**The Galaxy Project: from the Planck epoch to Montpellier**

[Dr. Anton Nekrutenko](/src/people/anton/index.md) and [Dr. James Taylor](/src/people/james-taylor/index.md) will present a keynote reviewing the history of the Galaxy project, and how it went from a humble Perl script to having its own international meeting in the South of France in the summer of 2017.

If you are reading this, you probably already know who they are.  If not, see their [bios here](https://gcc2017.sciencesconf.org/).

## And the rest of the schedule ...

... will be published this week on the [conference schedule web site](https://gcc2017.sched.com/).

## Submit a Lightning Talk!

<div class="left"><a href="https://gcc2017.sciencesconf.org/page/submit"><img src="/src/galaxy-updates/2017-06/lightning.png" alt='Stike out and strut your work with a GCC2017 lightning talk!' width="60" /></a></div>

Lightning talks are an excellent chance to share your work, preliminary or otherwise, with the community.  Lightning talks are 7 minutes long and are the quickest way to make a lasting impression on, and get feedback from all participants.  Submit your lightning talk proposal [by June 23](https://gcc2017.sciencesconf.org/page/submit). 


### Talk, Poster and Demo Submission is Closed, but ...

[Abstract submission](https://gcc2017.sciencesconf.org/page/submit) for regualr talks, posters and demos closed in May.  However you can still submit late oral prentations abstracts, posters and demos.  Late oral presentation abstracts are considered as cancellations occur, and posters and demos will be reviewed until the space is full.

<div class="right"><a href="https://gcc2017.sciencesconf.org/page/sponsors"><img src="/src/events/2017-gcc/sponsor-cloud.png" alt='2017 Galaxy Community Conference Sponsors' width="180" /></a></div>

## GCC2017 Sponsors

GCC2017 has [11 sponsors](https://gcc2017.sciencesconf.org/page/sponsors)!  Sponsors are potential partners in your research and sponsorships greatly lower the cost of conference registration.  Have a look at the [GCC2017 sponsor list](https://gcc2017.sciencesconf.org/page/sponsors) and plan on learning what they have to offer (and thanking them) while you are in Monpellier.

## GCC2017 Call for BoFs!

<div class="left"><a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdRCs97OWt47qmMxWZAtSV3TTLJ24IhW0m2lHGPLiqJU0Xkzw/viewform"><img src="/src/events/2017-gcc/gcc2017-bofs.png" alt='2017 Galaxy Community Conference BoFs' width="170" /></a></div>

There is no better place than a Galaxy Community Conference to meet and learn from others doing data-intensive biology.  [GCC2017](https://gcc2017.sciencesconf.org/) continues this tradition by again including *[Birds of a Feather (BoF)](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birds_of_a_feather_%28computing%29)* meetups.  Birds of a Feather meetups are informal gatherings where participants group together based on common interests.

Interested?

* [See already proposed BoFs](https://gcc2017.sched.com/overview/type/Conference/BoF)

# Galaxy Tutorial @ ISMB/ECCB 2017

<div class="right"><a href="https://www.iscb.org/ismbeccb2017-program/tutorials#p6"><img src="/src/images/logos/ismb-2017.png" alt="Galaxy Tutorial at ISMB/ECCB 2017: Making Galaxy Work for You" width="170" /></div>

Know someone who needs to learn more about deploying Galaxy in their organization? There will be a half day [Making Galaxy Work for You](https://www.iscb.org/ismbeccb2017-program/tutorials#p6) tutorial at [ISMB/ECCB 2017](https://www.iscb.org/ismbeccb2017) in Prague, Czechia. The tutorial will provide a practical, hands-on guide to adapting the Galaxy platform to the specific needs of individuals attending the ISMB.

Participants will learn to

- Create Galaxy compatible tool and workflow definitions that are publicly accessible and that make it easy for any instance administrator to add your work to their server. 
- Deploy Galaxy and scale it up to target production-ready resources such as a Postgres database, NGINX webserver, and distributed resource managers such SLURM or PBS.

Interested? Sign up when you [register](https://www.iscb.org/ismbeccb2017-registration#tutorials) for ISMB/ECCB (and register before the tutorial fills up).

We also expect a lot of other Galaxy-related content at ISMB/ECCB 2017 and [BOSC 2017](https://www.open-bio.org/wiki/BOSC_2017). We'll add the presentations to the [Galaxy @ ISMB/ECCB 2017 & BOSC 2017](/src/events/2017-ismb-bosc/index.md) event page as the schedules are posted.  (And, [please let us know](mailto:outreach@galaxyproject.org) if you have anything on the program.)

See you in Prague!

Galaxy has reached many different communities far beyond classical NGS. To support this the [IUC](/src/iuc/index.md) is organising regularly contribution fests dedicated to special topics, with the aim to increase tool coverage and develop re-usable workflows. One of the first contribution fests focused on metagenomics, a field that is gaining more traction in the Galaxy community. Here we highlight two pull requests that were recently merged and added [Qiime (Quantitative Insights Into Microbial Ecology)](https://github.com/galaxyproject/tools-iuc/pull/431) and [mothur](https://github.com/galaxyproject/tools-iuc/pull/1287) to Galaxy. These tools are the most popular pipelines used by the microbial ecology community to perform microbiome analyses from raw DNA sequencing data.

Based on previous work by James Johnson, ~150 tools were developed and adapted to the most recent IUC standards for Galaxy tools, including integration with [BioConda](https://bioconda.github.io/) and [BioContainers](https://biocontainers.pro/). This effort was led by [Saskia Hiltemann](https://github.com/shiltemann) and [BÃ©rÃ©nice Batut](http://bebatut.fr/) and several reviewers and contributors, who created more than 300 commits and touched more than 600 files (including test-data). Thanks Saskia and BÃ©rÃ©nice for this effort!

The tools can be installed via the Galaxy Tool Shed:

* [Qiime](https://toolshed.g2.bx.psu.edu/view/iuc/suite_qiime)
* [mothur](https://toolshed.g2.bx.psu.edu/view/iuc/suite_mothur)

Both tool suites and many more metagenomics tools are integrated into the [metagenomic Galaxy flavor](https://github.com/shiltemann/galaxy-metagenomics).

</div>

The [Galaxy Committers](https://github.com/galaxyproject/galaxy/blob/dev/doc/source/project/organization.rst) published the **[17.05 release of Galaxy](https://docs.galaxyproject.org/en/master/releases/17.05_announce.html)** in May.

**Tag your data with propagating hashtags**

* Large Galaxy histories used to be messy. Hashtags make it easy to track dataset (and collection) relationships.
* These two movies (both under a minute) explain how to use this [with datasets](https://vimeo.com/216884518) and [with collections](https://vimeo.com/216895965).
* Learn more about Galaxy histories in our updated [tutorial](https://galaxyproject.org/tutorials/histories/).

**Drag & Drop datasets into tool inputs**

* Interface now allows dragging datasets from history panel into the content selectors of the tool form.
* Implemented in [Pull Request 3871](https://github.com/galaxyproject/galaxy/pull/3871).

**Upload directly to a collection**

* You can now bypass the history manipulation and upload your data straight into a collection for convenience.
*  Learn more about collections and how to use them in a new [tutorial](https://galaxyproject.org/tutorials/collections/).

We extend special thanks to the 64 [New Contributors](https://docs.galaxyproject.org/en/master/releases/17.05_announce.html#new-contributors) to Galaxy in the past year.

Additionaly there are [New Configuration Options](https://docs.galaxyproject.org/en/master/releases/17.05_announce.html#new-configuration-options)  and [New Datatypes](https://docs.galaxyproject.org/en/master/releases/17.05_announce.html#new-datatypes) sections.


### Galaxy Docker Image 17.05

The [Galaxy Docker project has seen a new release](https://github.com/bgruening/docker-galaxy-stable/releases/tag/17.05), following Galaxy 17.05. Major features are an additional Docker compose setup with SLURM and HT-Condor deployments, BioContainers integration and much more automatic testing.

And

* The [Galaxy Docker Project](https://github.com/bgruening/docker-galaxy-stable) has reached more than 23k downloads on [Dockerhub](https://hub.docker.com/r/bgruening/galaxy-stable/) - not counting quay.io and all flavors

## Parsec 1.0.0 - 1.0.2

[Parsec](https://github.com/galaxy-iuc/parsec) is a newly released set of command-line utilities to assist in working with Galaxy servers.  It uses automatically generated wrappers for BioBlend functions. Manage histories, launch workflows, and more, all from the command line. The README includes several examples.


## Planemo 0.41.0

<div class='right'><br /><a href='https://pypi.python.org/pypi/planemo/'><img src="/src/images/galaxy-logos/planemo-logo.png" alt="" width="200" /></a></div>

See [GitHub for details](https://github.com/galaxyproject/planemo/blob/master/HISTORY.rst).


## BioBlend 0.9.0

[BioBlend](http://bioblend.readthedocs.org/) is a Python library for interacting with CloudMan and Galaxyâ€˜s API.  BioBlend makes it possible to script and automate the process of cloud infrastructure provisioning and scaling via CloudMan, and running of analyses via Galaxy.

See the [release notes](https://github.com/galaxyproject/bioblend/releases) for what's new in release 0.9.0.


## galaxy-lib 17.5.9-11

galaxy-lib is a subset of the Galaxy core code base designed to be used as a library. This subset has minimal dependencies and should be Python 3 compatible.  It's available from [GitHub](https://github.com/galaxyproject/galaxy-lib) and [PyPi](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/galaxy-lib).

## Galaxy CloudMan 17.05 on AWS

A new release of [Galaxy CloudMan](/src/cloudman/index.md) is available on the Amazon Web Services cloud infrastructure. This release includes Galaxy 17.05, an updated [tool list](https://github.com/galaxyproject/galaxy-cloudman-playbook/blob/master/files/usegalaxy_main_tool_list.yaml), and Slurm configuration changes to improve job performance. To get started, vist https://beta.launch.usegalaxy.org/ or take a look at the [Getting Started](/src/cloudman/index.md#getting-started) guide.


## Earlier Releases

Other packages that have been released in the prior 4 months.

### CloudLaunch ##

Technically, the [all-new Galaxy CloudLaunch service](https://beta.launch.usegalaxy.org/) has been in public beta since February but keep in mind that it will replace the [current CloudLaunch service](https://launch.usegalaxy.org/launch) eventually so give it a try and let us know how it performs for you.

### CloudBridge 0.2.0

[CloudBridge](https://github.com/gvlproject/cloudbridge) aims to provide a simple layer of abstraction over different cloud providers, reducing or eliminating the need to write conditional code for each cloud. It is currently under development and is in an Alpha state.  [Release 0.2.0](https://github.com/gvlproject/cloudbridge/releases/tag/v0.2.0) includes several fixes and enhancements.

### And the rest ...

Other Galaxy packages that haven't had a release in the past four months can be [found on GitHub](https://github.com/galaxyproject).
