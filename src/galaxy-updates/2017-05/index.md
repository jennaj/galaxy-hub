## GCC2017 Call for BoFs!

There is no better place than a Galaxy Community Conference to meet and learn from others doing data-intensive biology.  [GCC2017](https://gcc2017.sciencesconf.org/) continues this tradition by again including *[Birds of a Feather (BoF)](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birds_of_a_feather_%28computing%29)* meetups.  Birds of a Feather meetups are informal gatherings where participants group together based on common interests.

BoF meetups are encouraged throughout GCC2017.  **The [current list of BoFs is available on the conference web site](http://bit.ly/gcc2017bofs).** BoFs are posted as soon as they are proposed.  The exact time and schedule for each will be set in mid to late June.

**Want to plan a BoF?**

To launch a Birds of a Feather meetup **[submit your BoF idea here](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdRCs97OWt47qmMxWZAtSV3TTLJ24IhW0m2lHGPLiqJU0Xkzw/viewform).** Once submitted, the conference organizers will create the [BoF in the conference schedule](http://bit.ly/gcc2016BOFS), and give you edit access.

**BoF Support**

The conference *enables and encourages* BoFs by

* Encouraging conference participants to organize BoFs
* Promote BoFs to all conference participants, over and over, both before and during the conference.
* Coordinate and reserve rooms for BoFs, and allocate time in the schedule for them too.

# Galaxy Tutorial @ ISMB/ECCB 2017

<div class="right"><a href="https://www.iscb.org/ismbeccb2017-program/tutorials#p6"><img src="/src/images/logos/ismb-2017.png" alt="Galaxy Tutorial at ISMB/ECCB 2017: Making Galaxy Work for You" width="170" /></div>

Ther will be a half day tutorial on [Making Galaxy Work for You](https://www.iscb.org/ismbeccb2017-program/tutorials#p6) at [ISMB/ECCB 2017](https://www.iscb.org/ismbeccb2017) in Prague, Czechia. The tutorial will provide a practical, hands-on guide to adapting the Galaxy platform to the specific needs of individuals attending the ISMB.

Participants will learn to

- Create Galaxy compatible tool and workflow definitions that are publicly accessible and that make it easy for any instance administrator to add your work to their server. 
- Deploy Galaxy and scale it up to target production-ready resources such as a Postgres database, NGINX webserver, and distributed resource managers such SLURM or PBS.

Interested? Sign up when you [register](https://www.iscb.org/ismbeccb2017-registration#tutorials) for ISMB/ECCB (and register before the tutorial fills up).

We also expect a lot of other Galaxy-related content at ISMB/ECCB 2017 and [BOSC 2017](https://www.open-bio.org/wiki/BOSC_2017). We'll add the presentations to the [Galaxy @ ISMB/ECCB 2017 & BOSC 2017](/src/events/2017-ismb-bosc/index.md) event page as the schedules are posted.  (And, [please let us know](mailto:outreach@galaxyproject.org) if you have anything on the program.)

See you in Prague!

<div class='right'><a href='http://getgalaxy.org'><img src="/src/images/logos/GalaxyNewLogo_GalaxyProject_Trans.png" alt="GalaxyProject" width="200" /></a></div>

The [Galaxy Committers](https://github.com/galaxyproject/galaxy/blob/dev/doc/source/project/organization.rst) published the **[17.01 release of Galaxy](https://docs.galaxyproject.org/en/master/releases/17.01_announce.html)** in February.


#### Highlights

Some highlights:

* **Conda auto initialization is enabled by default**
* **New interface for user preferences**
* **Support for compressed FASTQ formats**

#### Release Notes

For full details on all of the enhancements and fixes in this release, please see the [full release notes](https://docs.galaxyproject.org/en/master/releases/17.01_announce.html).


#### Galaxy Docker Image 17.01

And, thanks to [BjÃ¶rn GrÃ¼ning](/src/people/bjoern-gruening/index.md), there is also now [a Docker image for Galaxy 17.01](https://github.com/bgruening/docker-galaxy-stable/releases/tag/17.01) as well.

### CloudLaunch ##

Technically, the [all-new Galaxy CloudLaunch service](https://beta.launch.usegalaxy.org/) has been in public beta since February but keep in mind that it will replace the [current CloudLaunch service](https://launch.usegalaxy.org/launch) eventually so give it a try and let us know how it performs for you.

### CloudBridge 0.2.0

[CloudBridge](https://github.com/gvlproject/cloudbridge) aims to provide a simple layer of abstraction over different cloud providers, reducing or eliminating the need to write conditional code for each cloud. It is currently under development and is in an Alpha state.  [Release 0.2.0](https://github.com/gvlproject/cloudbridge/releases/tag/v0.2.0) includes several fixes and enhancements.


### Planemo 0.39 - 0.40

<div class='right'><br /><a href='https://pypi.python.org/pypi/planemo/'><img src="/src/images/galaxy-logos/planemo-logo.png" alt="" width="200" /></a></div>

[Planemo](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/planemo) is a set of command-line utilities to assist in building tools for the Galaxy project.  These releases included [numerous fixes and enhancements](https://github.com/galaxyproject/planemo/blob/master/HISTORY.rst).

See [GitHub for details](https://github.com/galaxyproject/planemo/blob/master/HISTORY.rst).

### Starforge 0.3

<div class='right'>
<a href='https://github.com/galaxyproject/starforge/blob/master/README.rst'><img src="/src/images/galaxy-logos/starforge_logo_big.png" alt="Starforge" width="180" /></a>
</div>

[Starforge](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/starforge) is a collection of scripts that supports the building of components for Galaxy.  Specifically, with Starforge you can:

* Build [Galaxy Tool Shed](http://toolshed.g2.bx.psu.edu/) dependencies
* Build [Python Wheels](http://pythonwheels.com/) (e.g. for the [Galaxy Wheels Server](http://wheels.galaxyproject.org/))
* Rebuild Debian or Ubuntu source packages (for modifications)

These things will be built in Docker. Additionally, wheels can be built in QEMU/KVM virtualized systems.

Documentation can be found at [starforge.readthedocs.org](http://starforge.readthedocs.org/). 

### Pulsar 0.7.4

<div class='right'><a href='https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pulsar-app/'><img src="/src/images/galaxy-logos/pulsar_transparent.png" alt="Pulsar" width="170" /></a></div>

A [Pulsar](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pulsar-app/) update was released in February.  Pulsar is a Python server application that allows a Galaxy server to run jobs on remote systems (including Windows) without requiring a shared mounted file systems. Unlike traditional Galaxy job runners - input files, scripts, and config files may be transferred to the remote system, the job is executed, and the results are transferred back to the Galaxy server - eliminating the need for a shared file system.

[This release](https://github.com/galaxyproject/pulsar/blob/master/HISTORY.rst) contains Conda and flake8 updates.

### sequence_utils

Galaxy's [sequence utilities](https://github.com/galaxyproject/sequence_utils) are a set of Python modules for reading, analyzing, and converting sequence formats.


### And the rest ...

Other Galaxy packages that haven't had a release in the past four months can be [found on GitHub](https://github.com/galaxyproject).
