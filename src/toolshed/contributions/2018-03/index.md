## New Tools

* *From [galaxyp](https://toolshed.g2.bx.psu.edu/view/galaxyp):*
   * [metagene_annotator](https://toolshed.g2.bx.psu.edu/view/galaxyp/metagene_annotator):  MetaGeneAnnotator gene-finding program for prokaryote and phage. MetaGeneAnnotator (MGA) precisely predicts all kinds of   prokaryotic genes from a single or a set of anonymous   genomic sequences having a variety of lengths.   The MGA integrates statistical models of prophage genes,   in addition to those of bacterial and archaeal genes,   and also uses a self-training model from input sequences   for predictions. As a result, the MGA sensitively detects   not only typical genes but also atypical genes, such as   horizontally transferred and prophage genes in a   prokaryotic genome.     MetaGeneAnnotator results are used by sixgill to generate   metapeptides.    http://metagene.cb.k.u-tokyo.ac.jp/    doi: 10.1093/dnares/dsn027.
* *From [bgruening](https://toolshed.g2.bx.psu.edu/view/bgruening):*
   * [hicexplorer_hiccomparematrices](https://toolshed.g2.bx.psu.edu/view/bgruening/hicexplorer_hiccomparematrices):  Wrapper for HiCExplorer: hicCompareMatrices. Sequencing techniques that probe the 3D organization of the genome generate large amounts of  data whose processing, analysis and visualization is challenging. Here, we present Hi-C Explorer,  a set of tools for the analysis and visualization of chromosome conformation data. Hi-C explorer  facilitates the creation of contact matrices, correction of contacts, TAD detection, merging,  reordering or chromosomes, conversion from different formats and detection of long-range contacts.  Moreover, it allows the visualization of multiple contact matrices along with other types of data  like genes, compartments, ChIP-seq coverage tracks (and in general any type of genomic scores) and long range contacts.    doi: 10.5281/zenodo.159780    Repository-Maintainer: Björn Grüning    https://github.com/maxplanck-ie/HiCExplorer.
