      CAMERA: http://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/CAMERA.html <br />
      This function check annotations of ion species with the help of a sample from opposite ion mode. As first step it searches for pseudospectra from the positive and the negative sample within a retention time window. For every result the m/z differences between both samples are matched against specific rules, which are combinations from pos. and neg. ion species. As example M+H and M-H with a m/z difference of 2.014552. If two ions matches such a difference, the ion annotations are changed (previous annotation is wrong), confirmed or added. Returns the peaklist from one ion mode with recalculated annotations.<br />

* *From [yhoogstrate](https://toolshed.g2.bx.psu.edu/view/yhoogstrate):*
  * [crossmap](https://toolshed.g2.bx.psu.edu/view/yhoogstrate/crossmap): (Planemo upload) for repository https://github.com/ErasmusMC-Bioinformatics/crossmap_galaxy_wrapper commit d4e9fe61901a612c78d9f26f172537b27fd2ddbb CrossMap: Convert genome coordinates or annotation files between genome assemblies. CrossMap is versatile tool to convert genome coordinates or annotation files between genome assemblies. It supports mostly commonly used file types, including BAM, BED, BigWig, GFF, GTF, SAM, Wiggle, and VCF formats. For large plain text file types, such as BED, GFF, GTF and VCF, reading from remote servers and file compression are supported.<br />
  * [segmentation_fold](https://toolshed.g2.bx.psu.edu/view/yhoogstrate/segmentation_fold): (Planemo upload) for repository https://github.com/ErasmusMC-Bioinformatics/segmentation_fold_galaxy_wrapper commit b37cb65736e2a6e76b94a9fa12a5887046437e36 RNA-Folding including predefined segments including K-turns Segmentation-fold is a bioinformatics application that predicts RNA 2D-structure with an extended version of the Zuker algorithm. This modification contains a new "structure element" named a segment and is capable of folding a pre-defined substructure with multiple canonical or non-canonical pairings. This allows folding of more complex structures like the K-turns, which are also part of the implemented free energy tables. These thermodynamic parameters (free Gibbs energy levels) have been estimated using a computational approach and therefore lack accuracy.

* *From [devteam](https://toolshed.g2.bx.psu.edu/view/devteam):*
  * [kraken2tax](https://toolshed.g2.bx.psu.edu/view/devteam/kraken2tax): (Planemo upload) for repository https://github.com/galaxyproject/tools-devteam/blob/master/tool_collections/taxonomy/kraken2tax/ commit f176c58ce66d9db715151061ea43912f0659afc0 Convert Kraken output to Galaxy taxonomy data. Kraken is a system for assigning taxonomic labels to short DNA sequences, usually obtained through metagenomic studies. This tool will convert the output of Kraken to the format used by other Galaxy taxonomic tools

* *From [damion](https://toolshed.g2.bx.psu.edu/view/damion):*
  * [versioned_data](https://toolshed.g2.bx.psu.edu/view/damion/versioned_data) first version This tool enables retrieval of FASTA format databases (by date or version id) that can be set up in a number of archive formats. As well one can trigger workflows like makeblastdb to generate BLAST databases. Results can be cached for reuse by other users who make the same requests. This tool can be used on a server both via the command line and via the Galaxy bioinformatics workflow platform using the "Versioned Data" tool. Different kinds of content are suited to different archiving technologies, so the system provides a few storage system choices. Results are cached so that subsequent requests for the same versioned database or derived data (like a BLAST database) are immediately satisfied.
