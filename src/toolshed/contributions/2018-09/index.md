   * [multigps](https://toolshed.g2.bx.psu.edu/view/greg/multigps):  MultiGPS is a framework for analyzing collections of multi-condition ChIP-seq datasets and characterizing differential binding events between conditions. MultiGPS is a framework for analyzing collections of multi-condition ChIP-seq datasets and characterizing differential binding events between conditions. In analyzing multiple-condition ChIP-seq datasets, MultiGPS encourages consistency in the reported binding event locations across conditions and provides accurate estimation of ChIP enrichment levels at each event.

* *From [waqas](https://toolshed.g2.bx.psu.edu/view/waqas):*
   * [macaron](https://toolshed.g2.bx.psu.edu/view/waqas/macaron):  A python framework to identify and re-annotate multi-base affected codons in whole genome/exome sequence data. Predicted deleteriousness of coding variants is a frequently used criterion to filter out variants detected in next-generation sequencing projects and to select candidates impacting on the risk of human diseases. Most available dedicated tools implement a base-to-base annotation approach that could be biased in presence of several variants in the same genetic codon. We here proposed the MACARON program that, from a standard VCF file, identifies, re-annotates and predicts the amino acid change resulting from multiple single nucleotide variants (SNVs) within the same genetic codon.

IDBA-UD is a iterative De Bruijn Graph De Novo Assembler for Short Reads Sequencing data with Highly Uneven Sequencing Depth. It is an extension of IDBA algorithm. IDBA-UD also iterates from small k to a large k. In each iteration, short and low-depth contigs are removed iteratively with cutoff threshold from low to high to reduce the errors in low-depth and high-depth regions. Paired-end reads are aligned to contigs and assembled locally to generate some missing k-mers in low-depth regions. With these technologies, IDBA-UD can iterate k value of de Bruijn graph to a very large value with less gaps and less branches to form long contigs in both low-depth and high-depth regions.   This tool is a wrapper for the idba_ud assembler.

PlasFlow is a set of scripts used for prediction of plasmid sequences in metagenomic contigs.  It relies on the neural network models trained on full genome and plasmid sequences and is able  to differentiate between plasmids and chromosomes with accuracy reaching 96%. It outperforms  other available solutions for plasmids recovery from metagenomes and incorporates the thresholding  which allows for exclusion of incertain predictions.
   * [porechop](https://toolshed.g2.bx.psu.edu/view/iuc/porechop):  Porechop - Finding and removing adapters from Oxford Nanopore reads. Porechop is a tool for finding and removing adapters from Oxford Nanopore reads.  Adapters on the ends of reads are trimmed off, and when a read has an adapter in  its middle, it is treated as chimeric and chopped into separate reads. Porechop  performs thorough alignments to effectively find adapters, even at low sequence  identity. Porechop also supports demultiplexing of Nanopore reads that were  barcoded with the Native Barcoding Kit, PCR Barcoding Kit or Rapid Barcoding Kit.
