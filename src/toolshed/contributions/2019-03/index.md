## New Tools

* *From [galaxyp](https://toolshed.g2.bx.psu.edu/view/galaxyp):*
   * [dia_umpire](https://toolshed.g2.bx.psu.edu/view/galaxyp/dia_umpire):  DIA-Umpire analysis for data independent acquisition (DIA) mass spectrometry-based proteomics. DIA-Umpire is an open source Java program for computational analysis of data independent acquisition (DIA) mass spectrometry-based proteomics data. It enables untargeted peptide and protein identification and quantitation using DIA data, and also incorporates targeted extraction to reduce the number of cases of missing quantitation.   http://diaumpire.sourceforge.net/.
* *From [imgteam](https://toolshed.g2.bx.psu.edu/view/imgteam):*
   * [imagecoordinates_flipaxis](https://toolshed.g2.bx.psu.edu/view/imgteam/imagecoordinates_flipaxis):  Flip coordinate axes. Makes x the horizontal axis (left to right) and y the vertical axis (bottom to top), like in a coordinate system.
* *From [iuc](https://toolshed.g2.bx.psu.edu/view/iuc):*
   * [scanpy_plot](https://toolshed.g2.bx.psu.edu/view/iuc/scanpy_plot):  Wrapper for the scanpy tool suite: Plot with scanpy. Scanpy is a scalable toolkit for analyzing single-cell gene expression data. It includes preprocessing, visualization, clustering, pseudotime and trajectory inference and differential expression testing.
   * [scanpy_normalize](https://toolshed.g2.bx.psu.edu/view/iuc/scanpy_normalize):  Wrapper for the scanpy tool suite: Normalize with scanpy. 
   * [scanpy_inspect](https://toolshed.g2.bx.psu.edu/view/iuc/scanpy_inspect):  Wrapper for the scanpy tool suite: Inspect with scanpy. 
   * [scanpy_cluster_reduce_dimension](https://toolshed.g2.bx.psu.edu/view/iuc/scanpy_cluster_reduce_dimension):  Wrapper for the scanpy tool suite: Cluster and reduce dimension with scanpy. 
   * [kraken2](https://toolshed.g2.bx.psu.edu/view/iuc/kraken2):  Kraken2 for taxonomic designation. Kraken is a system for assigning taxonomic labels to short DNA  sequences, usually obtained through metagenomic studies. Previous attempts by other  bioinformatics software to accomplish this task have often used sequence alignment  or machine learning techniques that were quite slow, leading to the development  of less sensitive but much faster abundance estimation programs. Kraken aims to  achieve high sensitivity and high speed by utilizing exact alignments of k-mers  and a novel classification algorithm.
   * [scanpy_filter](https://toolshed.g2.bx.psu.edu/view/iuc/scanpy_filter):  Wrapper for the scanpy tool suite: Filter with scanpy. 
   * [scanpy_remove_confounders](https://toolshed.g2.bx.psu.edu/view/iuc/scanpy_remove_confounders):  Wrapper for the scanpy tool suite: Remove confounders with scanpy. 
   * [berokka](https://toolshed.g2.bx.psu.edu/view/iuc/berokka):  Berokka is used to trim, circularise, orient & filter long read bacterial genome assemblies. There is already a good piece of software to trim/circularise and orient genome assemblies called Circlator. Please try that first!   You should only try Berokka if...   1) You only have the contig files and do not have the corrected reads anymore.  2) Your contigs are simple cases with clear overhang and could be done manually with BLAST.  3) Circlator fails on your data even after troubleshooting.  Berocca is a brand of effervescent drink and vitamin tablets containing vitamin B and C. It is a popular cure for a hangover. A key role of the berokka tool is to remove the "overhang" that occurs at the ends of long-read assemblies of circular genomes.
* *From [chemteam](https://toolshed.g2.bx.psu.edu/view/chemteam):*
   * [gmx_merge_topology_files](https://toolshed.g2.bx.psu.edu/view/chemteam/gmx_merge_topology_files):  Wrapper for the gromacs package: Merge GROMACS topologies. GROMACS is a versatile package to perform molecular dynamics, i.e. simulate the Newtonian equations of motion for systems with hundreds to millions of particles.  It is primarily designed for biochemical molecules like proteins, lipids and nucleic acids that have a lot of complicated bonded interactions, but since GROMACS is extremely fast at calculating the nonbonded interactions (that usually dominate simulations) many groups are also using it for research on non-biological systems, e.g. polymers.  GROMACS supports all the usual algorithms you expect from a modern molecular dynamics implementation (check the online reference or manual for details).
   * [bio3d_dccm](https://toolshed.g2.bx.psu.edu/view/chemteam/bio3d_dccm):  Wrapper for the Bio3D package: DCCM analysis. Bio3D is an R package containing utilities for the analysis of protein structure, sequence and trajectory data.

Optionally, predefined star sequences can be mapped to the precursors too.   By that the mature and star sequence in the precursors are determined. Second, the deep sequencing reads are mapped to the precursors.   The number of reads falling into an interval 2nt upstream and 5nt downstream of the mature/star sequence is determined.

The module uses output files provided by the quantifier.pl module from miRdeep2 and assigns the matures to the precursors by using the following order of priority:     - Mature known in the species studied (generaly all matures from miRBase known for the species are used)     - Mature known in another species (all mature from miRBase, or only those corresponding to a subset of closely related species are used). In case where several mature are detected, mature with the highest count is chosen.     - Mature unknown (generaly matures predicted by miRDeep2.pl module are used)  Wrappers are the product of Valentin Marcon, Kevin Normand & Sylvain Marthey (Thanks to INRA Migale, IFB ressources & INRA GABI).
