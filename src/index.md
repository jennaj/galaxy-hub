Galaxy is an open, web-based platform for accessible, reproducible, and
transparent computational research.

- **Accessible:** programming experience is not required to easily upload data, run complex tools and workflows, and visualize results.
- **Reproducible:** Galaxy captures information so that you don't have to; any user can repeat and
  understand a complete computational analysis, from tool parameters to the dependency tree.
- **Transparent:** Users share and publish their histories, workflows, and visualisations via the web.
- **Community centered:** Our inclusive and diverse users (developers, educators, researchers, clinicians, etc.) are empowered to share their findings.


Welcome to the Galaxy Community Hub, where you'll find community curated documentation of all things Galaxy.
