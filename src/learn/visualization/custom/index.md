---
There are many custom visualizations available for Galaxy which are not part of the Galaxy core package. Here, we provide an overview for such visualizations.

| Resource | Domain | Owners | Formats | Description |

| [DeepTools](/src/learn/visualization/custom/deep-tools/index.md) | NGS, QC, Normalization, Visualization | [Max-Planck-Institut f√ºr Immunbiologie und Epigenetik](http://www.ie-freiburg.mpg.de) | BAM, bigWig, BED | User-friendly tools for the normalization and visualization of deep-sequencing data |
| [MetaPhlAn](/src/learn/visualization/custom/metaphlan/index.md) | NGS, Visualization | [Harvard School of Public Health](http://www.hsph.harvard.edu/) | Sequence file (.fasta, .fastq, .tar.bz2 etc.) | A computational tool for profiling the composition of microbial communities from metagenomic shotgun sequencing data. |
| [VideoViz](/src/learn/visualization/custom/video-viz/index.md) | Imaging, Microscopy, other Video Data | [Center for Phage Technology](https://cpt.tamu.edu/) | Mp4 | This visualization provides support for video playback inside galaxy. It is part of a push to add more tools, formats, and converters to support imaging data. |
