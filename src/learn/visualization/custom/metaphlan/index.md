MetaPhlAn is a computational tool for profiling the composition of microbial communities from metagenomic shotgun sequencing data.
MetaPhlAn is available as a Galaxy module and as a bitbucket repository. For additional information, please refer to the MetaPhlAn paper.
We provide support for MetaPhlAn users. Please join our Google group designated specifically for MetaPhlAn users. Feel free to post any questions on the google group by posting directly or emailing metaphlan-users@googlegroups.com
