title: Learn Galaxy
---
There are many approaches to learning how to *use* Galaxy. The most popular is probably to just dive in and use it. Galaxy is simple enough to use that you can do many analyses just by exploring the interface. However, you may miss much of the power this way.

## Tutorials using Galaxy Main

These tutorials are using Galaxy's main site at http://usegalaxy.org:

 - [Galaxy 101](/tutorials/g101) - the basic introduction to Galaxy's interface, its functionality, and workflows. **Start here** if you never used Galaxy before.
 - [Uploading data](/tutorials/upload) - how to get data into Galaxy.
 - [Histories](/tutorials/histories) - in Galaxy uploaded data and analysis results reside within the history pane. This tutorial explains how history works.
 - [Dataset collections](/tutorials/collections) - modern studies usually include many samples. Collection are designed to simplify complex, multi-sample analyses as shown in this tutorial.
 - [NGS logistics](/tutorials/ngs) - this is an introduction to Galaxy's functionality for the analysis of Next Generation Sequencing data.
 - Variant discovery: [diploid case](/tutorials/var_dip) - this tutorial explains calling sequence variants in **diploid** systems like ... humans.
 - Variant discovery: [haploid case](/tutorials/var_hap) - this tutorial explains calling sequence variants in **haploid** systems like ... bacteria and viruses.
 - RNA-seq: [Introduction](/tutorials/rb_rnaseq) - an introductory tutorial for transcriptome analysis.
 - RNA-seq: [Discovering and quantifying new transcripts](/tutorials/nt_rnaseq) - an in-depth transcriptome analysis example.
 - ChIP-seq: [A simple ChIP-seq experiment with two replicates](/tutorials/chip) - an example analysis for finding transcription factor binding sites.
