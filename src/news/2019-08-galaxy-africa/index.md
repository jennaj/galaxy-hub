After a successful [Galaxy Africa 2018 in South Africa](http://galaxyafrica.sanbi.ac.za/), we are pleased to announce the **[next Galaxy Africa workshop](https://www.iscb.org/iscbafrica2019-ps/iscbafrica2019-worktut#galaxy)** will be held 14-15 November, in collaboration with the [ASBCB/ISCB Africa 2019 conference](https://www.iscb.org/iscbafrica2019) in Kumasi, Ghana. Building on the previous event, we will offer Galaxy training for researchers, and training for systems administrators who need to maintain a local installation. 

**Intended audience and level**<br />
Galaxy Africa will target 2 audience groups:

* Those aiming to do bioinformatics on the Galaxy platform. The content for this group will be aimed at an introductory level for prospective bioinformaticians.
* Those intending to run Galaxy as a service for their bioinformatics users. The audience here is systems administrators for bioinformatics facilities.

This year we are calling for abstracts for three oral presentations that demonstrate the use of Galaxy in your research projects. Abstracts should be [submitted as Oral Presentations to the main conference](https://www.iscb.org/iscbafrica2019-call/iscbafrica2019-oral-submission) with their use of Galaxy clearly marked. 

We hope to see you in Ghana!<br />
