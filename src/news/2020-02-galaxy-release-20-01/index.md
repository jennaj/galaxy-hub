We are pleased to announce the release of Galaxy

A few release highlights are:

Workflow Executions Menu
------------------------

This menu can be reached from the User menu -> Workflow Invocations and lists your recent Workflow executions, their status and links to the Workflow Editor and the History with the results of the Workflow run.

Enhanced workflow functionality
-------------------------------

Workflows can now make use of optional datasets and optional parameters, optional parameter default values and dataset inputs can now be restricted to
user-defined datatypes. The workflow editor and execution engine have been enhanced to allow defining options to choose from, and these options can be
connected to compatible text, integer, float, color and select tool parameters for more flexible and universally reusable workflows

Galaxy Markdown Pages and Workflow Reports as PDF
------------------------------------------------

An additional link has been added to Galaxy Markdown Pages and Workflow reports that exports your document as a standalone PDF.

Screen Reader friendly Navigation
--------------------------------

The top menu and the Workflow Editor have been improved for easier navigation using Screenreaders and the Keyboard.

Email-notification for completed jobs
-------------------------------------

You can now select to be notified by email when a tool run has finished.

_Thanks for using Galaxy!_
