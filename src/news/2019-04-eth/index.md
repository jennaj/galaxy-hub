The [Animal Genomics](http://www.ag.ethz.ch) and [Animal Physiology](http://www.ap.ethz.ch) groups at the [Institute of Agricultural Sciences](http://www.ias.ethz.ch/), [ETH Zurich](http://www.ethz.ch/), are seeking a [Postdoctoral Researcher](https://apply.refline.ch/845721/6985/pub/1/index.html) to implement bioinformatic methods that combine short and long sequencing reads for *de novo* assembly of large animal genomes. This work will address sequence variation in livestock populations and the complex regulation of physiology. Reproductive challenges are specifically in focus and include an epigenetic perspective on cellular communication in livestock and wildlife. 

Sequencing technologies that generate long-read sequence data from single molecules at sufficient throughput facilitate the *de novo* assembly of large genomes at unprecedented contiguity. High-quality genome assemblies are available for many mammalian species but such a resource is missing for the European roe deer (*Capreolus capreolus*). We envisage the successful candidate to combine long- and short-read sequencing data to generate a first de-novo assembly of the European roe deer and to perform RNA-Seq and Methyl-Seq analyses.

We offer a very well-equipped facility at ETH Zurich in a working environment of young, emerging research groups at the Institute of Agricultural Sciences. The successful candidate will have access to state of the art sequencing and high-performance computing facilities as well as a running Galaxy server. Collaboration across the interdisciplinary groups and international cooperation are anticipated and highly encouraged. Publication activities and participation at international conferences are very much supported.

We are looking for a highly motivated early career researcher with a strong enthusiasm for cutting-edge research at the intersection of computational biology, bioinformatics and functional genomics, all in the context of livestock and wildlife physiology. The successful candidate is expected to contribute to ongoing genomics-related projects, including administration of a local Galaxy server, in our young interdisciplinary research group.

A PhD in Bioinformatics, Genomics or a discipline related to the outlined project is required. Proficiency in the analysis of long-read sequencing data is expected and experience in the assembly of eukaryotic genomes is highly desired. Candidates should have demonstrated their ability to work independently in an interdisciplinary research environment.

We look forward to receiving your online application including a letter of motivation and a detailed CV including a publication list and copies of certificates. Please address your application to: ETH Zurich, Prof. Susanne E. Ulbrich & Prof. Hubert Pausch. We exclusively accept applications submitted through our online application portal. Applications via email or postal services will not be considered. **Please [submit your application online](https://apply.refline.ch/845721/6985/pub/1/index.html).**

For further information about our groups, please visit our websites: www.ag.ethz.ch  and www.ap.ethz.ch. For further information about the position and questions related to the research opportunities at ETH Zurich, please contact Prof. Ulbrich at sulbrich@ethz.ch (no applications) or Prof. Pausch at hubert.pausch@usys.ethz.ch (no applications).

Kind regards

Susanne Ulbrich & Hubert Pausch
