The [Blankenberg](/src/people/dan/index.md) Lab in the [Genomic Medicine Institute](http://www.lerner.ccf.org/gmi/) at the [Cleveland Clinic Lerner Research Institute](https://www.lerner.ccf.org/) has several [Postdoctoral Fellowships](http://www.lerner.ccf.org/jobs/postdoctoral/#760) available. We utilize high-throughput omics technologies, such as next generation sequencing, and data-intensive computing to explore biomedical research questions.
