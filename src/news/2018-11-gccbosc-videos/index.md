**We are pleased to announce that videos from [GCCBOSC 2018](https://gccbosc2018.sched.com/) are now available online** and are linked to from the [conference web site](https://gccbosc2018.sched.com/).  Talks from the GCC parts of the meeting are available on a **[Galaxy Vimeo channel](https://vimeo.com/channels/gccbosc2018)**, and talks from the BOSC parts are available on a **[BOSC YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLir-OOQiOhXaHvCY_KYshsOMULuXDqvh7)** (and joint keynotes are available on both).

There are over 70 presentations across both channels, showing every talk from the opening keynote to the closing keynote.
