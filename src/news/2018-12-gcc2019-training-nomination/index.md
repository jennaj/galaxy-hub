The [**2019 Galaxy Community Conference (GCC2019)**](/src/events/gcc2019/index.md) will be held in be held in **Freiburg, Germany, 1-6 July**. Like [previous Galaxy Community Conferences](/src/gcc/index.md), GCC2019 will feature invited keynotes, accepted talks, posters, demos, birds-of-a-feather gatherings and **training**. The format of GCC this year will be a bit different than the previous years: it starts with 1 day of training and then 3 days with more specialized training sessions aligned with talks. *You can read more about the new format on the [conference FAQ](/src/events/gcc2019/faq/#what-will-be-the-format-for-gcc-in-2019).*

**The training topics that are offered are determined by *the community* so *[BY YOU!](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1fBPjEmw7Td52rhBnC0SvflnQCD7Ue5IMJ9RkM0SjnYg/)***

Please give some thought to what topics you would like to see offered, or that you would like to offer, and then [submit them as topic nominations](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1fBPjEmw7Td52rhBnC0SvflnQCD7Ue5IMJ9RkM0SjnYg/). 

Nominated topics can cover a wide range. For example:

- Introduction to Using Galaxy
- Scientific topic oriented trainings
- Community specific trainings
- Development and administration around Galaxy
- Train the trainers

This list only shows some examples. **Any topic of interest to the Galaxy Community can be nominated and you are encouraged to nominate more than one topic.** If you are looking for ideas, see the topic nominated in: [2016](https://bit.ly/gcc2016noms), [2015](https://bit.ly/gcc2015vote), [2014](https://bit.ly/1s6NtMN), [2013]( https://bit.ly/1i2j1gN) and the [Galaxy Events page](https://galaxyproject.org/events/).

Training nomination is open from **December, 1st** to **December, 31**. Topics will be compiled into a uniform list by the GCC2019 Organizing Committee, and topics will be voted on by the Galaxy Community from **January, 15th** to **January, 31st**.

Topics will then be selected and scheduled based on topic interest, and the organisers' ability to confirm instructors for each session. Some very popular sessions may be scheduled more than once. The final schedule will be posted before registration opens.
