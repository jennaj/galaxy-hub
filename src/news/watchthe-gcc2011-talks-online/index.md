NBIC, the host and co-sponsor of the [2011 Galaxy Community Conference (GCC2011)](https://galaxyproject.org/gcc2011/) sponsored the videotaping of all talks at the meeting and has now made those recordings available for viewing online.  See the [GCC2011](https://galaxyproject.org/gcc2011/) page for links.

We had several requests for this, and I would like to thank NBIC for making this happen.
