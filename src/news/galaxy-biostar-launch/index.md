***Note: Galaxy's support forum has now moved to [help.galaxyproject.org](https://help.galaxyproject.org/).***

**Galaxy has teamed up with [Biostar](http://biostars.org) to create a [Galaxy User support forum](https://biostar.usegalaxy.org) at https://biostar.usegalaxy.org!**

We want to create a space where researchers using Galaxy can come together and share both scientific advice and practical tool help.  Whether on [usegalaxy.org](https://usegalaxy.org), a CloudMan instance, or any other Galaxy ([public](/src/use/index.md) or local), if you have something to say about *Using Galaxy*, this is the place to do it!

**Current integration with usegalaxy.org**

* We imported the **whole history of the `galaxy-user@bx.psu.edu`** mailing list into *[Galaxy Biostar](https://biostar.usegalaxy.org)*. Your prior posts are automatically claimed when you login! 
* If you access [Galaxy Biostar](https://biostar.usegalaxy.org) from http://usegalaxy.org (Menu: **Help &rarr; Galaxy Biostar**) you will be automatically logged in. A Galaxy Biostar account will be created for you if it did not previously exist. To obtain this account’s password please use the [password reset feature](https://biostar.usegalaxy.org/accounts/password/reset/) of Galaxy Biostar.
* When you have a question, search Galaxy Biostar directly from any Galaxy tool page.

Read more about how to get started on the [Biostar wiki page](/src/support/biostar/index.md).

**Roll-out phase**

* [Galaxy Biostar](https://biostar.usegalaxy.org) is available at [biostar.usegalaxy.org](http://biostar.usegalaxy.org) and will be our primary avenue for support
* The galaxy-user@bx.psu.edu mailing list will continue to be supported during the transition but starting now please use the [Galaxy Biostar forum](https://biostar.usegalaxy.org) to ask all questions about using Galaxy.
* Please *do not double post* to both [Galaxy Biostar](https://biostar.usegalaxy.org) and galaxy-user@bx.psu.edu
* *Send us feedback in [this Biostar post](https://biostar.galaxyproject.org/p/7288/)* to tell us what you think. *We care!*

**What’s next**

* Notice will be given when the galaxy-user@bx.psu.edu mailing list is retired.
* Archives of galaxy-user@bx.psu.edu will remain accessible.

We hope you will like the change and look forward to any feedback you may have.


*Thank you for using Galaxy!*
