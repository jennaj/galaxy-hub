**Gateways 2019 Call for Participation** (Abstracts due April 29; Full submissions due May 6)

Call for Participation: Gateways 2019 (September 23–25, San Diego, California) is now accepting submissions of papers, demos, tutorials, and panels (2–4 pages) on the topic of gateways for science, engineering, or other disciplines. Gateways are user-friendly interfaces to scientific computing, data, and other domain-specific resources to support research and education.

Topics may include their design, use, impact, development processes, sustainability, best practices, or any other aspect that you think fellow gateway creators or users will find interesting to learn. We also welcome educational topics directed toward the next generation of gateway creators. **In addition, this year Gateways 2019 is co-located with the [eScience](https://escience2019.sdsc.edu/) conference.** The two conferences will offer shared sessions and connected registration.

**Abstracts are due April 29, and full submissions are due May 6, 2019.** A poster session deadline (open to all attendees) will be August 15. Read more details in the [Call for Participation](http://sciencegateways.org/gateways2019/call).
