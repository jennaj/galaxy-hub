The 28th [Plant and Animal Genome Conference (PAG 2020)](http://www.intlpag.org/) will be held January 11-15, in San Diego, California. PAG is the largest ag-genomics meeting in the world, with over 3000 participants, and 5 days of programming.

Galaxy, as we do every year, will [have a presence](/src/events/2020-pag/index.md) at PAG 2020, including a two hour workshop introducing the project and how to use the Galaxy platform.  We'll also have a talk on the [Galaxy Training Network](https://training.galaxyproject.org/), and if 2020 is anything like previous years (it will be), numerous other Galaxy-related presentations from the Galaxy Community. 

We will add everything we know about, as we find about it, to the [Galaxy @ Pag page](/src/events/2020-pag/index.md).  Watch that space.

**PAG Deadlines this Week**

If you work in agricultural research, then PAG is a very effective way to get the word out about the work you do, and we strongly encourage you to submit an abstract to PAG **this week**:

* [Poster](https://www.intlpag.org/2020/abstracts/poster-submission) deadline: Friday, October 27
* [Digital Tools and Resources](https://www.intlpag.org/2020/abstracts/digital-tools-and-resources-abstract-info) deadline: Friday, October 27
* [Early Registration](https://www.intlpag.org/2020/attend/registration-and-fees) deadline:  Friday, November 1

We particularly encourage you to submit an abstract to the [Digital Tools and Resources](https://www.intlpag.org/2020/abstracts/digital-tools-and-resources-abstract-info) track.  This is a great way to demonstrate your Galaxy (and non-Galaxy) resources to the ag research community.

**GMOD Codefest, January 9-10**

The [GMOD Project](http://gmod.org/) (which Galaxy is a member of) will be holding a [two day codefest](http://gmod.org/wiki/Codefest_2020) immediately before PAG starts. This is an opportunity to learn more about GMOD and to contribute to [GMOD components](http://gmod.org/wiki/Main_Page) and to the larger GMOD community as well.

If you have any project ideas for this event, then [please add them here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1_CnUW_W4tNyl7lSlihCwZDKT45VQQxcI3I-VgjnC2Dc/edit). 

**Pangenome metadata scopeathon, January 16-17**<br />
*(Updated 2019-11-25)*

NCBI is organizing a [Pangenome metadata scopeathon](https://ncbiinsights.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/2019/11/19/metadata-scopeathon/) on January 16-17, immediately following PAG.  This event is about planning and designing software to extract value from organismal and genera-level graph genomes by dynamically labeling with metadata.

Interested? [Apply now](https://support.nlm.nih.gov/Pan_Meta_Scopeathon/).

Hope to see you in San Diego,<br />
