**[Vote now on the training topics you want!](/src/events/gccbosc2018/training/index.md)**

[Voting is now open](http://bit.ly/gccbosc2018-vote) on what [training topics](/src/events/gccbosc2018/training/index.md) will be offered at [GCCBOSC 2018](https://gccbosc2018.sched.com/).

[Your vote](http://bit.ly/gccbosc2018-vote) will determine the topics that are offered, which topics should be offered more than once,  and which ones should not be scheduled at the same time.  Your vote matters. 

**Topic voting closes January 31.** The Training schedule, including instructors, will be published before early registration opens.

[GCCBOSC2018](https://gccbosc2018.sched.com/) will be held 25-30 June in Portland, Oregon, United States. It will feature two days of training: the second of which is multi-track and will feature content for both the BOSC and Galaxy communities.  Workshops will be hands-on and participants will be strongly encouraged to bring a laptop and follow along.  If you work in data-intensive biomedical research, there is no better place than GCCBOSC 2018 to present your work and to learn from others.

Thanks, and see you in Portland!
