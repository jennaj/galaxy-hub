The [Open Life Science program](https://openlifesci.org/) helps **early stage researchers and potential academic leaders** to become Open Life Science ambassadors.

Participants of this 15-week mentoring & training program will learn essential knowledge required to create, lead, and sustain an Open Science project, connect with members across different communities, backgrounds, and identities by sharing their experiences and expertise. The complete schedule and participation guidelines of the program are [available online](https://openlifesci.org/syllabus).

This program gives an unique opportunity to develop an Open Science project that participants either already have been working on, or want to develop in the near future within life sciences. More information regarding the roles and benefits for our mentees and eligibility of a proposed project can be found on our website.

The first cohort will run from **January to April 2020**. [Applications are open](https://easychair.org/cfp/ols-2020) until **8 December 2019** (midnight in any part of the world). 

To answer any questions related to this program, an online information session (webinar) will be held on [27 November 2019 at 4pm GMT](https://arewemeetingyet.com/Berlin/2019-11-27/17:00/OpenLifeSci%20&%20eLife%20Application%20Webinar) via this [Zoom room](https://zoom.us/j/653381208). Agenda and notes can be found [there](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1EIDzZi5mgRiWR7cJQl0up470C87GsbcoTR_6-cs-SeE/edit?usp=sharing).
