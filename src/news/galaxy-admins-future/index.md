The [GalaxyAdmins group](/src/community/galaxy-admins/index.md) is coming up on it's one year anniversary and this is a good time to discuss where the group should go moving forward.  See the [GalaxyAdmins Future Directions page](/src/community/galaxy-admins/future/index.md) for a summary of issues, including:

* [Goals and Activities](/src/community/galaxy-admins/future/index.md#galaxyadmins-goals-and-activities)
* [Leadership Models and Selection](/src/community/galaxy-admins/future/index.md#leadership)
* and a summary of the [group's history](/src/community/galaxy-admins/future/index.md#history).

These topics are currently being discussed in email thread.  Whatever consensus and plan we reach will be posted to the [wiki page](/src/community/galaxy-admins/future/index.md).  Ideally we should have a plan of action in place before [GCC2103](/src/events/gcc2013/index.md) at the end of June.
