[usegalaxy.org](https://usegalaxy.org/) and [Galaxy Test](https://test.galaxyproject.org) will be down for filesystem maintenance at TACC from 9:00 a.m. to 2:00 p.m. (US Central Time, [see your time](https://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/fixedtime.html?msg=usegalaxy.org+maintenance+down+time+window&iso=20170919T09&p1=24&ah=5)) on Tuesday, 19 September 2017 while system updates are performed.  We will let you know through Galaxy channels as soon as the systems are back up.  Any jobs running when maintenance starts will be terminated.

In the meantime, feel free to use the [more than 90 public Galaxy servers](/src/use/index.md) or a [Galaxy service](/src/use/index.md).

We apologize for any inconvenience this causes.
