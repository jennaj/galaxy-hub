[InterMine team](http://intermine.org/) has just [released InterMine 4.1.0](https://intermineorg.wordpress.com/2019/09/24/intermine-4-1-0/).

The new release includes a better integration with Galaxy: we can import data into Galaxy from any InterMine of our choice (either starting from InterMine or Galaxy), and we can export a list of identifiers from Galaxy to any InterMine of our choice through the InterMine registry. No need to configure anything any more: all the Galaxy properties have been moved to InterMine core. No need to create a mine-specific Galaxy tool anymore, use the NEW intermine tool instead. Please read [here](https://intermine.readthedocs.io/en/latest/webapp/third-party-tools/galaxy/) for more details. A simple InterMine tutorial will be published soon in the [Galaxy Training Material](https://galaxyproject.github.io/training-material/), under the [Data Manipulation](https://galaxyproject.github.io/training-material/topics/galaxy-data-manipulation/) topic.

See the [full release announcement](https://intermineorg.wordpress.com/2019/09/24/intermine-4-1-0/) and [release notes](https://github.com/intermine/intermine/releases) for more on this release.
