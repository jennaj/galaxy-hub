Hello all,

When I picked Monday, 22 April, as the (original) deadline for GCC2019 oral presentation and lightning talk [abstracts](/src/events/gcc2019/abstracts/index.md) I had no idea

* that 21 April was Easter, or
* that Easter weekend is a much bigger holiday outside the US, than inside the US.

I am now keenly aware of that second fact as we have heard from many folks that 22 April was quite possibly the worst possible date for this deadline.

**We are extending the deadline to [submit a talk abstract](/src/events/gcc2019/abstracts/index.md) to the end of this Friday, 26 April ([anywhere in the world](https://www.timeanddate.com/countdown/launch?iso=20190427T00&p0=3399&msg=GCC+Abstract+EXTENSION%21&font=cursive)).**

With apologies for the original date,

[GCC2019](/src/events/gcc2019/index.md) will be held 1-8 July in Freiburg, Germany.  The *tenth* [GCC](/src/gcc/index.md) will have many familiar features from earlier years, including accepted and lightning talks, posters and demos, birds-of-a-feather gatherings (BoFs), training, and a CollaborationFest.  2019 also brings the [most significant conference program update](https://gcc2019.sched.com/) in several years:

* some training will be integrated with the main conference,
* three days of conference instead of two,
* several parallel sessions,
* and a strong emphasis on organizing content by domain.

GCC2019, like every GCC before it, will be built around *community*.  Training topics are nominated, selected, and presented by the community.  Presentations will  feature the full spectrum of Galaxy applications, enhancements and deployments from the community as well.

If you are working in data intensive life science research then there will not be a better place to share your work, learn from others, and find new collaborators.
