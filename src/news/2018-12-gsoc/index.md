Galaxy will be applying to participate in the [2019 Google Summer of Code](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/).  We will again be participating as part of the **[Open Genome Informatics Group](http://gmod.org/wiki/GSoC)** that also includes [Bioconda](https://bioconda.github.io/), [GMOD](http://gmod.org/), [Reactome](https://reactome.org), [MGI](http://www.informatics.jax.org/), [OICR](https://oicr.on.ca/research-portfolio/), and [WormBase](http://www.wormbase.org/).

"Google Summer of Code is a global program that offers student developers stipends to write code for various open source software projects. We work with many open source, free software, and technology-related groups to identify and fund projects over a three month period. Since its inception in 2005, the program has brought together over 14,000 successful student participants from 118 countries, 651 open source organizations, and over 35 million lines of code. Through Google Summer of Code, accepted student applicants are paired with a mentor or mentors from the participating projects, thus gaining exposure to real-world software development scenarios and the opportunity for employment in areas related to their academic pursuits. In turn, the participating projects are able to more easily identify and bring in new developers. Best of all, more source code is created and released for the use and benefit of all."

We are currently building our group's proposal.  If you have an idea for a project that you would be interested in mentoring someone for, then please add it to the proposal, either [directly on this page](http://gmod.org/wiki/GSOC_Project_Ideas_2019) (requires an account), of via this [online form](http://bit.ly/gsoc-2019-ogi-propose).

The deadline for submitting your projects is February 1.
