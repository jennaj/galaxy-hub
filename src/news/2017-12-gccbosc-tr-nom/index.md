**[Nominate a training topic Now](http://bit.ly/gccbosc2018-tr-nom)**

The joint [2018 Galaxy Community and Bioinformatics Open Source Conferences](https://gccbosc2018.sched.com/) start with training and **the training topics are determined by you**. Please take a few minutes to consider what you would like to learn at GCCBOSC2018. Any topics of interest to these communities can be nominated. 

[GCCBOSC2018](https://gccbosc2018.sched.com/) will be held 25-30 June in Portland, Oregon, United States. It will feature two days of training: the second of which is multi-track and will feature content for both the BOSC and Galaxy communities.  

Nominated topics can cover a wide range. For example:

- How to use open source software using just a web browser (e.g., Intro to Using Galaxy) 
- How to use software packages (The Newbie's Guide to BioRuby)
- Advanced applications of software (Genome Assembly with Galaxy, or Proteomics with BioPython)
- Software installation and configuration (Tool Wrapping for Galaxy, or Using CloudLaunch)
- Open source community (Building a Curation Community using Apollo, or Training using the Galaxy Training Network)

These are only examples!  If you are looking for ideas, see topics nominated for [GCC2017](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1jyCndVqfXx-HsyFJ4hjaK075vDbPM1kE58qO2lJTOG8/edit?usp=sharing), [GCC2016](http://bit.ly/gcc2016noms), [GCC2015](http://bit.ly/gcc2015vote), and the [Galaxy Events page](/src/events/index.md), which lists what training the community is offering outside of GCCs.  *Training is not limited to Galaxy-related topics.  Don't be afraid to think inside the BOSC!*

Basically, if you think the communities would be interested in a topic, then please [nominate it](http://bit.ly/gccbosc2018-tr-nom)!

Nominated topics will be [published](/src/events/gccbosc2018/training/index.md) as they come in.

**Topic Nominations close January 7**. Topics will be compiled into a uniform list by the GCCBOSC2018 organizers, and then voted on by the community starting one week later.
