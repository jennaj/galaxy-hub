[Sarepta Therapeutics](https://www.sarepta.com/) is looking for an experienced Galaxy user/programmer/administrative user to set up a pipeline either on local server or Cloud environment.   This will be a consulting type of work, applying 

* QC reads and trim adapter and low quality reads
* Create QC report using MultiQC tool
* Map and align the reads to reference genome (in our case plasmid reference sequence)
* Create report and summary of how well the reads mapped to reference genome
* Use variant calling tools to detect any variant (SNP, in/dels etc.) and determine their frequencies
* Add new or update existing tools used in workflow .
* Blast the reads unmapped to reference genome to either custom database or know databases to characterize the unmapped reads.
