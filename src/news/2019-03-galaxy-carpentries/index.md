At year's [Biohackathon](http://bh2018paris.info/index.html) we ([Saskia](https://github.com/shiltemann), [Bérénice](https://github.com/bebatut), and [Helena](https://github.com/hexylena) from Galaxy; and [Mateusz Kuzak](https://github.com/mkuzak) and [Fotis Psomopoulos](https://github.com/fpsom) from the Carpentries) applied for a [Mozilla Science](https://science.mozilla.org/) mini grant based on the idea of creating hybrid training materials (e.g. RNA-seq analysis in Galaxy followed by [Carpentries](https://www.carpentries.org/) style R coding for further analysis/visualisation) and piloting those materials in a hybrid workshop (streaming to multiple satellite locations).

We are pleased to have been [funded by Mozilla](https://medium.com/read-write-participate/meet-mozillas-latest-open-science-awardees-cfa45348e5d5#7d0f) to work on this project.

The **[Gallantries Project](https://galaxy-carpentries.github.io/gallantries/)** will focus on adaptation and delivery of existing training materials from various open communities for High Throughput Sequencing (HTS) data analysis skills needed in genomics research. Collaboration on material adaptation will take place through sprints, and delivery of training will be done at two 3-day workshops.

**Interested? Please join us on [Gitter](https://gitter.im/galaxy-carpentries) and [GitHub](https://github.com/galaxy-carpentries).**
