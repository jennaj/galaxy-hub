[GCC2019](/src/events/gcc2019/index.md) will be held 1-8 July in Freiburg, Germany.  GCC is a great opportunity to discuss your research with others that are working in and facing similar challenges in data-intenisve life science research.  *But only if you can get there.*

The Galaxy Community Fund is offering [fellowships](http://bit.ly/gcc2019fellowships) to students, post-docs, and other early career researchers who would benefit from attending GCC2019.

Fellowships include

- full registration for any GCC2019 events you attend
- the first â‚¬1200 in transport and lodging costs for the duration of those events 

If you are

1. an early career researcher (student, post-doc, junior staff or faculty),
1. and attending GCC2019 will help your research, your career, or your communities

*then you are strongly encouraged to apply.*

Fellowship applications will be selected based on multiple criteria including

- Your research! And ... 
- How well you can describe it in a poster, demo or lightning talk abstract 
- How much impact attending will have on you and your current and future communities, especially historically underrepresented communities and research and education in developing countries.

See the [application](http://bit.ly/gcc2019fellowships) for full details on what's covered and what we ask you to provide.

**We'll review applications in two rounds, one starting on 23 April, and the other on 10 May. Interested?  [Submit an abstract](https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=gcc2019) and [apply for a fellowship](http://bit.ly/gcc2019fellowships).  If you have visa concerns, you are encouraged to submit and apply by 22 April.**

We hope to see you at [GCC2019](/src/events/gcc2019/index.md)!
