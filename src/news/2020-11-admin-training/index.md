**The [next Galaxy Admin Training will be offered online and asynchronously January 25-29](/src/events/2021-01-admin-training/index.md).**

This workshop will cover introductory and advanced topics you need to know to set up your own production, high-performance and multi-user Galaxy instance. Sessions will be intensive and hands-on, and taught by experienced instructors from the Galaxy Community. Participants will learn how to install, configure, customize, and extend their own Galaxy servers. Topics include tool configuration, authentication and user management, using heterogeneous storage and compute services, and many other topics that will enable you to get your own Galaxy server up and running, performing well, and used by your community.

**The workshop is free. However, space is limited and applications are expected to be competitive. Please submit an application by the end of December 18.**

Galaxy is an open web based platform for biomedical data integration and analysis. It is deployed at large and small organizations around the world and used in a broad range of biomedical research domains, and across the tree of life.
