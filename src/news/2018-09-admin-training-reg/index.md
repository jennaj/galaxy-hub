**The [2019 Galaxy Admin Training](/src/events/2019-admin-training/index.md) will be offered January 28 through February 1 at Penn State University** (where the Galaxy Project got started over ten years ago).  The workshop offers a [2 day introductory session](https://github.com/galaxyproject/dagobah-training#basic-sessions) followed by a [3 day advanced topics session](https://github.com/galaxyproject/dagobah-training#advanced-sessions).  Participants can register for one or both sessions.

This workshop will cover what you need to know to set up your own production, high-performance and multi-user Galaxy instance.  Sessions will be *intensive and hands-on*, and taught by experienced instructors from the Galaxy Community. Participants will learn how to install, configure, customize, and extend their own Galaxy servers. Topics include tool configuration, authentication and user management, using heterogeneous storage and compute services, and many other topics that will enable you to get your own Galaxy server up and running, performing well, and used by your community.

[Registration](/src/events/2019-admin-training/index.md#registration) is now open and starts at $40 / day for participants from non-profits and academia.  Early registration ends October 31.  However, the 2016 and 2018 admin training were both full, so you are strongly encouraged to *register now*.

*The workshop does have [prerequisites](/src/events/2019-admin-training/#prerequisites). Please read them before you register.*
