[BCC2020](https://bcc2020.github.io) brings together the Galaxy Community Conference and the Bioinformatics Open Source Conference (BOSC) into a single event featuring training, a meeting, and a CollaborationFest. Events run from July 17 through July 25, and will be held in both the eastern and western hemispheres.  It's a great opportunity to discuss your research with others working in and facing similar challenges in data-intensive life science research. *But it is only an opportunity if you able to participate.*
