[GCCBOSC 2018](https://gccbosc2018.sched.com/) will be held 25-30 June in Portland, Oregon, United States. This brings the 2018 Galaxy Community Conference and the Bioinformatics Open Source Conference together into a unified week-long event. If you work in open source life science or data-intensive biomedical research, then there is no better place than GCCBOSC 2018 to present your work and to learn from others.

## Events

[GCCBOSC](https://gccbosc2018.sched.com/) starts with [two days of training](https://gccbosc2018.sched.com/overview/type/C.x+Training+-+All) with a wide range of topics nominated and selected by our communities.  Training is followed by a two day meeting, with joint and parallel tracks, featuring oral presentations, posters, demos, lightning talks, birds-of-a-feather and [invited keynotes](/src/events/gccbosc2018/keynotes/index.md) from [Fernando PÃ©rez](/src/events/gccbosc2018/keynotes/index.md#bosc-gcc-joint-keynote-fernando-perez) of the [Berkeley Institute for Data Science](https://bids.berkeley.edu/) and [Project Jupyter](http://jupyter.org/), and [Tracy K. Teal](/src/events/gccbosc2018/keynotes/index.md#bosc-2018-keynote-tracy-k-teal) of The Carpentries.  The week finishes with *[CollaborationFest](/src/events/gccbosc2018/collaboration/index.md) Core* and *Encore*, two or four days of collaborative work on code, documentation, training and challenging data analysis problems.
