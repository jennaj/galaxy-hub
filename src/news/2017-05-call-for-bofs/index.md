There is no better place than a Galaxy Community Conference to meet and learn from others doing data-intensive biology.  [GCC2017](https://gcc2017.sciencesconf.org/) continues this tradition by again including *[Birds of a Feather (BoF)](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birds_of_a_feather_%28computing%29)* meetups.  Birds of a Feather meetups are informal gatherings where participants group together based on common interests.

BoF meetups are encouraged throughout GCC2017.  **The [current list of BoFs is available on the conference web site](http://bit.ly/gcc2017bofs).** BoFs are posted as soon as they are proposed.  The exact time and schedule for each will be set in mid to late June.

**Want to plan a BoF?**

To launch a Birds of a Feather meetup **[submit your BoF idea here](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdRCs97OWt47qmMxWZAtSV3TTLJ24IhW0m2lHGPLiqJU0Xkzw/viewform).** Once submitted, the conference organizers will create the [BoF in the conference schedule](http://bit.ly/gcc2016BOFS), and give you edit access.

**BoF Support**

The conference *enables and encourages* BoFs by

* Encouraging conference participants to organize BoFs
* Promote BoFs to all conference participants, over and over, both before and during the conference.
* Coordinate and reserve rooms for BoFs, and allocate time in the schedule for them too.
