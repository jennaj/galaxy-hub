**[Voting is now open](http://bit.ly/gcc2016vote)** on what training topics are offered at GCC2016 Training.

There are nominated topics spanning from basic usage to advanced deployment.  No matter what you do with Galaxy, there are topics for you to choose from.  [Your vote](http://bit.ly/gcc2016vote) will determine the topics that are offered, which topics should be offered more than once,  and which ones should not be scheduled at the same time.  Your vote matters. 

**Topic voting closes November 6.** The Training schedule, including instructors, will be published before early registration opens.

**About GCC2016 Training:**

The [2016 Galaxy Community Conference (GCC2016)](/src/events/gcc2016/index.md) will be held June 25-29 at [Indiana University](http://indiana.edu) in Bloomington, Indiana, United States. GCC2016 features two full days of training on June 26-27.  Each day will have multiple tracks, with each track featuring several sessions throughout the day.

Workshops will be hands-on and participants will be strongly encouraged to bring a laptop and follow along.

If you work in data-intensive biomedical research, there is no better place than GCC2016 to present your work and to learn from others.

As always, please let us know if you have any questions.

Thanks,

The [GCC2016 Exec](https://web.archive.org/web/http://gcc2016.iu.edu/Oorganizers)
