We are announcing the formation of **GalaxyWorks** (_[galaxyworks.io](https://galaxyworks.io/)_), a
company providing commercial services and support for Galaxy. Our goal is to
broaden the reach of Galaxy into new sectors by simplifying access to the
Galaxy software and providing enterprise-level services. Simplifying access to
Galaxy will allow users to focus on extracting value from data rather than
managing Galaxy.

GalaxyWorks provides Galaxy Pro, a product offering for commercial
organizations looking to use Galaxy for data analysis. **Galaxy Pro** is a
managed version of Galaxy in the cloud with capabilities that public Galaxy
servers do not plan to support, such as improved project- and customer-specific
privacy, security enhancements, and greater resource capabilities. In addition,
Galaxy Pro comes with professional services and support. Galaxy Pro comes with
a validated set of tools and workflows as well as customization services to
promote customer success. Galaxy Pro is available via subscription.

GalaxyWorks builds upon the existing Galaxy code base by advocating adoption of
Galaxy in the commercial space and creating new markets and users for Galaxy.
GalaxyWorks will be contributing software products developed through the
company back to the open-source community and provide help and support to all
Galaxy users. *We are absolutely committed to helping maintain and grow the
Galaxy open source community.*

In summary:

* **Galaxy**: the open-source, academic software, free servers, and a
  world-wide community; the Galaxy you know is unaffected and will continue to
  grow.
* **Galaxy Pro**: a managed version of Galaxy in the cloud with capabilities
  that public Galaxy servers do not plan to support, such as improved privacy,
  security enhancements, and resource capabilities as well as professional
  services and support. This product is provided by subscription.
* **GalaxyWorks** (_galaxyworks.io_): the company behind Galaxy Pro, and which
  will also contribute software features and user support to the broader Galaxy
  community.


# Why GalaxyWorks?

Our research shows that there is demand from organizations for using
Galaxy servers with commercial support. GalaxyWorks will improve adoption of
the Galaxy platform in new segments by offering users a managed, commercial
service that frees them from maintaining infrastructure and tools. By providing
a unified service that allows a user to focus on analyzing the data without the
need to manage the Galaxy server, GalaxyWorks will provide an important service
for the broader Galaxy community.


# Who is GalaxyWorks?

The  company was formed by several members of the Galaxy team and community:
Enis Afgan, Dannon Baker, Dan Blankenberg, John Chilton, Nate Coraor, Jeremy
Goecks, Nuwan Goonasekera, Aysam Guerler, Anton Nekrutenko, Stephanie Pond, and
the late James Taylor. In the future, we will explore options for interested
members of the Galaxy community to join as well. To help bootstrap the
development of the initial product, the company applied for and received
federal funding from the NIH in the form of an STTR grant (R41 HG010982).


# How will GalaxyWorks interact and contribute to the Galaxy Community?

Transparency, openness, and community are foundational values of the Galaxy
project community, and this will not change with GalaxyWorks. Galaxy will
remain open source, developed by a world-wide community of contributors and
users. GalaxyWorks aims to be a member of this ecosystem and will develop new
products and services to explore innovative applications and solutions.
GalaxyWorks is committed to contributing software features to Galaxy and the
community. Examples to date of software developed by GalaxyWorks and
contributed back to the Galaxy open-source codebase include:

* Initial prototype of the workflow invocation reports feature ([PR
  #8543](https://github.com/galaxyproject/galaxy/pull/8543))
* Extensions and improvements to Galaxyâ€™s authentication and authorization
  functionality (PRs[
  #9115](https://github.com/galaxyproject/galaxy/pull/9115),[
  #9150](https://github.com/galaxyproject/galaxy/pull/9150),[
  #9162](https://github.com/galaxyproject/galaxy/pull/9162),[
  #9168](https://github.com/galaxyproject/galaxy/pull/9168))
* Various usability improvements (PRs[
  #9062](https://github.com/galaxyproject/galaxy/pull/9062),[
  #9508](https://github.com/galaxyproject/galaxy/pull/9508),[
  #77](https://github.com/galaxyproject/galaxy-helm/pull/77))

All of these features have been adopted and subsequently further developed by
the Galaxy community.
