The next [Galaxy Community Conference](/src/events/gcc2019/index.md) will be in Freiburg (Germany) in July. This year the program is specifically aimed at drawing in more Galaxy end-users, including for training.  We are really interested it what you would like to learn.

**Please take a few minutes to [decide](/src/events/gcc2019/training/#nominated-training-topics) and then [vote which training should be offered during GCC2019](https://goo.gl/forms/iaY5AezdFpyJ0ETh2)!**

**Topic voting closes 4 February.** The Training schedule, including instructors, will be published before early registration opens.

[GCC2019](/src/events/gcc2019/index.md) will be held 1-6 July in Freiburg, Germany.  If you work in data-intensive biomedical research, there is no better place than GCC2019 to present your work and to learn from others.

Thanks, and see you in Freiburg
