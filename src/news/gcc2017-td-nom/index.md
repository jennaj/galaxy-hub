The [2017 Galaxy Community Conference (GCC2017)](https://gcc2017.sciencesconf.org/) features two days of training on 27-28 June. The first day will be single track and focus on how to use Galaxy for research. The second day will have multiple tracks, with each track featuring three sessions each.  GCC2017 will be held in [Monpellier, France](http://www.montpellier-france.com/).

**GCC2017 Training topics are [nominated by you](http://bit.ly/gcc2017trainingnom), the Galaxy Community.** Please give some thought to what topics you would like to see offered, or that you would like to offer, and then [submit them as topic nominations](http://bit.ly/gcc2017trainingnom).  Any topic of interest to the Galaxy Community can be nominated and you are encouraged to nominate more than one topic. If you are looking for ideas, see topics nominated for [GCC2016](http://bit.ly/gcc2016noms), [GCC2015](http://bit.ly/gcc2015vote), [GCC2014](http://bit.ly/1s6NtMN), [GCC2013](http://bit.ly/1i2j1gN), and the [Galaxy Events page](/src/events/index.md), which lists what training the community is offering outside of GCCs.

Nominated topics will be published as they come in.  **Topic nomination closes Friday, 20 January.**.  Topics will be compiled into a uniform list by the GCC2017 Organizing Committee, and topics will be voted on by the Galaxy Community starting a week later.

Topics will then be selected and scheduled based on topic interest, and the organisers' ability to confirm instructors for each session.  Some very popular sessions may be scheduled more than once. The final schedule will be posted before registration opens.
