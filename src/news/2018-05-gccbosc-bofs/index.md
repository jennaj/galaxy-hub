There is no better place than the upcoming [GCCBOSC 2018 Conference](https://gccbosc2018.sched.com/) to meet and learn from others doing data-intensive biology.  *[Birds of a Feather (BoF)](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birds_of_a_feather_%28computing%29)* meetups are informal gatherings where participants group together to discuss common interests.

GCCBOSC 2018 has more time allocated to BoFs than any previous BOSC or GCC did and BoFs are encouraged throughout the conference.  **The [current list of BoFs is available on the conference web site](http://bit.ly/gccbosc2018-bofs).** BoFs are posted as soon as they are proposed.  The exact time and schedule for each will be set in mid to late June.

**Want to organize a BoF?**

To launch a Birds of a Feather meetup **[submit your BoF idea here](http://bit.ly/gccbosc2018-bofs-call).** Once submitted, conference organizers will create the [BoF in the conference schedule](http://bit.ly/gccbosc2018-bofs), and then start promoting the BoF to attendees.

**Want to attend a BoF?**

It's easy. **Just show up.**

However, BoF and conference organizers will thank you if you indicate your interest [on the web page for any BoF you are interested in](http://bit.ly/gccbosc2018-bofs). You'll need to create a login.  Or, you can notify the BoF organizer(s) via email.
