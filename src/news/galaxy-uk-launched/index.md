Dear UK Galaxy-devs,

We're delighted to announce the launch of the UK Galaxy Community.

The aims of Galaxy-UK are:

* To bring the Galaxy community in the United Kingdom closer together
* Identify and address the needs of the community
* Encourage interaction and collaboration.

Galaxy-UK is also an information hub for events such as:
* UK based Galaxy training courses
* UK based talks involving Galaxy
* Information on the location of UK Galaxy servers
* Anything else that might be pertinent to bring the UK Galaxy users/admins together as a community

We will be organising both online meetings and physical meetings, so keep an eye on the site for these events. 

Best wishes,

The Galaxy-UK Team
