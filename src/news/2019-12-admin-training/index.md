**A [Galaxy Admin Training](/src/events/2020-03-admin/index.md) workshop will be offered 2-6 March at the [Barcelona Supercomputing Center](https://www.bsc.es/).**

This [workshop](https://github.com/galaxyproject/dagobah-training) will cover introductory and advanced topics you need to know to set up your own production, high-performance and multi-user Galaxy instance.  Sessions will be *intensive and hands-on*, and taught by [experienced instructors from the Galaxy Community](/src/events/2020-03-admin/index.md#instructors). Participants will learn how to install, configure, customize, and extend their own Galaxy servers. Topics include tool configuration, authentication and user management, using heterogeneous storage and compute services, and many other topics that will enable you to get your own Galaxy server up and running, performing well, and used by your community.

Galaxy is an open web based platform for biomedical data integration and analysis. It is deployed at large and small organizations around the world and used in a broad range of biomedical research domains, and across the tree of life.

Please see the [event page](/src/events/2020-03-admin/index.md) for prerequisites, instructor list, registration rates and deadlines, and registration and agenda links. Space is available on a first come, first served basis. (And, space is limited and this workshop usually fills up.)
