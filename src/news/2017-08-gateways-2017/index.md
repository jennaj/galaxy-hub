* **[Gateways 2017](https://sciencegateways.org/gateways2017)
:** The 12th Gateway Computing Environments Conference (formerly GCE)
* *Monday through Wednesday, October 23–25, 2017*
* *Hosted at the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor*

Science gateways allow science & engineering communities to access shared data, software, computing services, instruments, educational materials, and other resources specific to their disciplines. They are typically a web portal or a suite of desktop applications.

Gateway developers and users — regardless of their domain area — have a lot in common but have had few venues for exchanging experiences. **The expanded Gateways annual conference is an opportunity for gateway creators and enthusiasts to learn, share, connect, and shape the future of gateways.**

**[Early-bird registration](https://sciencegateways.org/web/gateways2017/attend/register) is now open through Friday, September 1.** (Regular registration closes Thursday, October 12.) Book now for the best rates!

The **[conference program](https://sciencegateways.org/web/gateways2017/program)** is already brimming with exciting keynotes, tutorials, and sessions (including a [CloudLaunch demo](http://sched.co/Bl3d)).

**Anyone is welcome to participate in the Poster Session.** [Submit an abstract for your poster by Friday, Sept. 8](https://sciencegateways.org/web/gateways2017/program/cfp#poster).

**Do you or a colleague offer resources or services that would be of interest to the science gateways community?** Consider reserving a space at [the Resource Expo](https://sciencegateways.org/web/gateways2017/program/resource-expo).
