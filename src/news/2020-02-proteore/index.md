We are pleased to announce the release of [ProteoRE 2.1](http://www.proteore.org/), a user-oriented Galaxy-based instance, for the functional interpretation and exploration of proteomics data for biomedical research; This version now comprises 20 tools organized in 4 sections (data manipulation and visualization; add features/annotation; functional analysis;  pathways analysis). All data sources have been updated. Three new tools were added while some of them were improved thanks to users feedbacks. Two tutorials are available via the [Galaxy Training Network](http://www.proteore.org/). We thank all ProteoREâ€™s users for their suggestions, the [IFB (French Bioinformatics Institute)](https://www.france-bioinformatique.fr/en) and the Galaxy community for their continuous support.
