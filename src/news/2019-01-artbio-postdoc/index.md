A 2-year position of genomic data analyst is available to work at a research project "COllaborative NEtwork on research for Children and Teenagers with Acute Myeloblastic Leukemia" CONECT-AML. The project is funded by the Institut National de Recherche sur le Cancer (INCA) and involves 10 participant teams across France, with clinical or fundamental approaches.

The candidate will work in [ARTbio](http://artbio.fr/) that is a participant team of CONECT-AML. ARTbio is the bioinformatic facility of the [Institut de Biology Paris Seine](http://www.ibps.upmc.fr/) located on the campus Jussieu of the Sorbonne-Universit√©.

The work package includes (i) better characterization of genetic abnormalities associated with AML in children and adolescents; (ii) Search for new predispositions; (iii) Study of myeloid leukemogenesis in three contexts of known predisposition -- congenital neutropenia, GATA2 mutation and Fanconi anemia.

Good knowledge and experience in NGS analysis (WES, WGS, RNAseq) as well as a solid background in statistics are mandatory.

Experience in analysis of rare genomic variants or genetics of human diseases, or advanced skills in Python or in the use of the Galaxy framework will be appreciated
