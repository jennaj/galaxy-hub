We are [organizing an informal dinner/social gathering for the Galaxy Community](http://bit.ly/ismbdinnerpoll) at [ISMB/ECCB/BOSC 2017](/src/events/2017-ismb-bosc/index.md), and we want to know which night we should have it.

*Dinner will be pay-your-own-way* and will be at a restaurant within walking or easy public transportation distance from the conference.

Please let us know **by 30th June** if you are interested and available to attend on any of these nights.  We'll let you know (and announce) final plans in the week or so before ISMB.

We hope to see you in Prague!  

Please [respond](http://bit.ly/ismbdinnerpoll) by Friday, 30th June.
