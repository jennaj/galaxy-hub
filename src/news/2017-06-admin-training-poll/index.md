Last November the Galaxy Project offered it's first ever week-long Galaxy Admin Training.  It was offered in Salt Lake City and drew ~35 participants from all over the world.  The material was presented again at [another training at the Galaxy Australasia Meeting](https://www.embl-abr.org.au/game2017/training-for-admin-workshop/) in February 2017.

For the coming year the project (and other groups) are interested in offering it again.  **[We would like your input](http://bit.ly/gatpoll)** to help us to decide where to offer this training again during the coming year.

Please [respond](http://bit.ly/gatpoll) by Friday, June 23.

Thanks,

Your friendly Galaxy Admin Trainer Community
