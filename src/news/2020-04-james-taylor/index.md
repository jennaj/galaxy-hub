We just lost James Taylor (1979-2020). His legacy — open, reproducible science — will continue.
</p>

James Taylor, a leader of the Galaxy Project, and one of its original members, passed away on April 2, 2020.

The community response (see below) has been tremendous, which reflects the breadth and depth of his impact.  If you have something you would like to add then please [share your thoughts here](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSd4iKUV7r91OxRFq6DbkVpSb4ftTP4eQqhvcSl-TD-PUdvFPw/viewform), and we will add them below.

The cause of James' death is not yet known, and given how overwhelmed the medical profession is in Baltimore, we may never know.  Given how quickly this overtook him it is very unlikely to have been COVID-19.  We will add any new information here as we learn it.

Thank you for your support during this awful time,<br />
The Galaxy Project
