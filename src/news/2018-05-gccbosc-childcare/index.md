You may not be aware that [childcare](/src/events/gccbosc2018/childcare/index.md) is available for the upcoming [GCCBOSC 2018 Conference](https://gccbosc2018.sched.com/), or **that the cost of childcare has recently dropped significantly due to sponsorship from [eLife(https://elifesciences.org/) and a microgrant from [ISB](https://www.biocuration.org/)**.

Childcare is provided by [Little Vikings](http://www.littlevikings.org/) child care in the [Smith Memorial Student Union](https://www.pdx.edu/student-union/) on the [Portland State University](https://www.pdx.edu/) campus in downtown Portland.  It is available for kids ages 6 weeks through 12 years old.

Childcare can be booked in half-day increments and **rates work out to $5.50/hour for kids of post-docs and students, and $7.75 for other kids**.  It's a great deal and allows scientists to attend meetings and bring their kids along as well. Childcare is available every day for the first 6 days of GCCBOSC.  That's the training, the meeting and CollaborationFest Core.

*Got an infant?* You can [bring them to the conference](/src/events/gccbosc2018/childcare/index.md#infants-and-nursing-parents).

We hope to see you, and your kids, in Portland,
