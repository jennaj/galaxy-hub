*We are delighted to announce that the [Galaxy Training Network (GTN)](https://training.galaxyproject.org/) has officially joined the [Global Organisation for Bioinformatics & Training (GOBLET)](http://mygoblet.org).*

GTN is a network of people and groups that present  Galaxy and Galaxy-based training around the world.  GOBLET provides "a global, sustainable support and networking structure for bioinformatics educators/trainers and students/trainees (including a training portal for sharing materials, tools, tips and techniques; guidelines and best practice documents; facilities to help train the trainers; and offering different learning pathways for different types of learner)."

GTN's GOBLET membership will raise the visibility of Galaxy, Galaxy training, and Galaxy Trainers in the bioinformatics community, and help make the Galaxy Community aware of what GOBLET and its members have to offer.

This membership was made possible by a unique arrangement where five GTN members each contributed 20% of the cost of a Bronze Organizational Membership:

* [Hans-Rudolf Hotz](/src/people/hansrudolf-hotz/index.md), [Friedrich Miescher Institute (FMI)](http://www.fmi.ch/), Switzerland
* [Björn Grüning](/src/people/bjoern-gruening/index.md), [University of Freiburg](http://www.uni-freiburg.de/), Germany
* [Mark Crowe](http://www.qfab.org/mark-crowe/), [QFAB](http://www.qfab.org/), Australia
* [UC Davis Bioinformatics Core Training Program](http://training.bioinformatics.ucdavis.edu/), United States
* [Galaxy Project](http://galaxyproject.org/), United States

Many thanks to these GTN members for making this happen, and to the GOBLET Executive for this opportunity.
