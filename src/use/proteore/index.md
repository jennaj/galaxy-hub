comments:
  - '"ProteoRE (Proteomics Research Environment) aims at centrally providing the proteomics community with an online research service enabling biologists/clinicians without programming expertise to **annotate and interpret** their proteomics data through the Web."'
  - "ProteoRE currently comprises tools (including graphical display) for:"
  - "Customary data manipulation (e.g. filtering, lists comparison, ID conversion…)"
  - "Protein list annotation (e.g. information retrieval from public resources - human species)"
  - "Functional analysis (e.g. GOterms frequencies, enrichment analysis) including graphical representation."
  - "Pathway analysis (e.g. Reactome)"
  - "This version also includes Galaxy generic tools and some tools from the [GalaxyP project](https://usegalaxyp.org/) that should be of great help for people who want to (re)process their MS-based proteomics data (e.g. peptide/protein identification)."
