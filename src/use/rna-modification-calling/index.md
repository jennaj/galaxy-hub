comments:
  - "Versatile user-friendly graphical workflow system for modification calling based on machine learning."
  - "The workflow commences with a principal module for trimming, mapping, and postprocessing."
  - "Postprocessign includes a quantification of mismatch and arrest rates with single-nucleotide resolution across the mapped transcriptome."
  - "Further downstream modules include tools for visualization, machine learning, and modification calling. "
