comments:
- 'Laniakea enables researchers to configure and deploy personal Galaxy instances. Each Galaxy instance is customizable in terms of virtual CPUs, RAM and storage through the web front-end, and deployable with different sets of pre installed tools. Each instance comes with reference data (e.g. genomic sequences) already available for many species, shared among all the instances.'
- 'Each Galaxy instance can be provided with an encrypted external storage volume to protect users research data from any unauthorized access attempts and linked to a repository of standard reference data (e.g., genomic sequences).'
- 'The service is scalable and both users and service providers can choose among a full range of different computational capabilities: from limited ones to serve e.g. small research groups, Galaxy developers or for didactic and training purposes, to instances with elasticity cluster support to deliver enough computational power.'
- 'Laniakea can also be employed as a tool publishing platform. That is, tools developers can choose to publish and make new tools available embedding them in a personalized Galaxy instance. See for example [PITE-T](http://igg.cloud.ba.infn.it/galaxy) and [VINYL](http://beaconlab.it/vinyl).'
- 'The Laniakea@ReCaS service, based on Laniakea software stack, has been released for public use, starting on 10 February 2020.'
