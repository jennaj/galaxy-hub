image: "/src/use/dintor/dintor.png"
comments:
  - 'A "suite of tools that facilitate working with GWA and NGS data" and "offers modules for high level functional annotation of genes and gene products such as gene set prioritization, functional similarity of proteins, or clinical significance of variation data. Each of these tools has been designed to perform a basic task independently."'
  - 'Includes "more than thirty modules ready for use by bioinformaticians and biologists working in genomics research."'
  - '"The Galaxy server has been set up to facilitate access to our **`Dintor`** tools by biologists with little background in bioinformatics. A second, expert mode of invocation is given by command line access to the tool suite, which can be downloaded"'
  - "[Admin and deployment documentation is available](http://dintor.eurac.edu/doc/doc/index.html)."
