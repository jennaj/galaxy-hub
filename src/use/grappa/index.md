comments:
  - "Efforts to increase GrAPPAâ€™s functionality are underway. Features now being incorporated include a larger repertoire of pre-processing options, including Gaussian graphical models and an expanded set of correlation metrics such as mutual information; more powerful post-processing capabilities, for example, software tools for Bayesian analysis; and links to related web-centric resources, e.g. GeneWeaver, so that users can seamlessly transfer data and results"
