comments:
  - "ChimeRScope is a java application  that uses a novel alignment-free approach for discovering fusion genes from transcriptome-sequencing (RNA-seq) datasets. Prediction results from simulated datasets and real datasets show that our method achieves the best prediction accuracy, comparing to all other popular methods."
