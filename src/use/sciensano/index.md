comments:
  - "Galaxy server is optimized for analysis of Illumina data, but also supports IonTorrent data. Pacific Biosciences and Oxford Nanopore Technologies data are not (yet) supported."
user_support:
  - "This Galaxy instance is provided 'as-is' with limited user support. Bugs can be reported through the issue reporting functionality of Galaxy and will be investigated."
  - "A set of YouTube videos is scheduled to be released in the beginning of 2020 documenting the most interesting tools for public health applications."
quotas:
  - "You must agree and read with the usage policy before using this Galaxy instance."
  - "Requires that you create an account to access it."
  - "Only 2 jobs can be run simultaneously for a single user. Other jobs will be put into the job queue."

  - "Quotas can be increased for collaborative projects."
  - "Datasets and histories will be automatically deleted after 12 weeks."
