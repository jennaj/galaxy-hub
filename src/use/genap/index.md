comments:
  - "[GenAP](https://www.genap.ca/) is targeting both life scientists through web portal applications such as Galaxy, datahub, and a UCSC Genome Browser mirror to facilitate data analysis, sharing and visualization of the results; as well as computational biologists through services such as state-of-the-art analysis pipelines and centralized code distribution."
  - "In GenAP each PI's (Principal Investigator) project can instantiate a private Galaxy which is shared only within  his/her own group. The group admin has the ability to create, start, stop and delete the group's Galaxy."
  - "The Galaxy jobs are sent to one of our clusters and the jobs are computed against the annual allocation of each PI inside [Compute Canada](https://www.computecanada.ca). Presently, Galaxy is running in two of the major clusters in Canada, Mammouth ([Université de Sherbrooke](http://www.usherbrooke.ca) ~40,000 cores) and Guillimin ([Mcgill](https://www.mcgill.ca/) ~21,000 cores). Other universities and HPC centers will join GenAP in the up coming year."
  - "GenAP is planning to release a fully public Galaxy instance by the end of the summer."
