comments:
  - "A free online analytical pipeline for developing chemometric approaches."
  - "Chemometrics is a collection of tools for extracting information from spectral data. The methods are essentially linear, with regressions, discriminant analyzes, unsupervised classifications, spectral decompositions, multi-array-multipath methods, plus pretreatments. Many applications focus on the near infrared. Its complementarity with the [Chemoocs mooc on France Digital University](https://www.fun-mooc.fr/) guarantees the correct use of chemometrics tools."
