summary: " TreeGenes integrates genotype, phenotype, and environmental data that can be processed for association mapping and landscape genomics, with a focus on forest trees. This functionality is provided by [Tripal Galaxy](https://github.com/tripal/tripal_galaxy), a module for [Tripal](http://tripal.info) that provides seamless support for running Galaxy workflows directly in the site. Users can analyze data provided by TreeGenes or their own."
