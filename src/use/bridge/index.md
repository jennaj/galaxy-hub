comments:
- "BRIDGE (Biomolecular Reaction and Interaction Dynamics Global Environment) is a Computational Chemistry flavour of Galaxy - a webserver for preparing, simulating and analysing and visualising molecular simulations, especially molecular dynamics and free energies.  Software such as NAMD, GROMACS and CHARMM can be used to define and simulate biological macromolecules, perform conformational analysis from trajectory data and conduct data analytics of large scale protein motions using statistical rigor."
