Today we launch the new *[Galactic Blog](/src/blog/index.md)*.

The *Galactic Blog* is a place for longer-form posts that are relevant to Galaxy. (See [Galaxy News](/src/news/index.md) for shorter-form items.)

**Our very first post is about the [ELIXIR Galaxy Community](/src/blog/2017-10-05-elixir-galaxy-community/index.md) and was written by Frederik Coppens, Gildas Le Corguillé, and [Björn Grüning](/src/people/bjoern-gruening/index.md).**

The *Galactic Blog* replaces the former *Community Log* and includes all content from it, which is why, even though the blog is new, it includes entries back to 2013.

## The Galactic Blog needs you!

The Galaxy community needs to know what you are doing.  If you done something that others would benefit from then please think about creating a *Galactic Blog* post describing your experiences.

Blog posts can either be directly created to the Hub, or can be posted on your favorite blogging platform and linked to from the [Blog home page](/src/blog/index.md).  See [the CONTRIBUTING page](https://github.com/galaxyproject/galaxy-hub/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#blog-metadata) for how.
