title: Deploy an Instance of Galaxy on Google Kubernetes Engine
highlight: true
---

We break the steps of deploying a Galaxy instance on
[Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE)](https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/)
to the following sections:

- [Create a K8s cluster](#create-a-cluster);
- [Install and configure Helm](#install-helm);
- [Deploy an instance of Galaxy using Helm charts](#deploy-galaxy-on-the-cluster);
- [Access Galaxy](#access-galaxy);
- [Delete cluster](#delete-resources-and-gke-cluster). 

> Note that all the commands given in this tutorial have been tested in 
[_Cloud shell_](https://cloud.google.com/shell/); however, they may be
applicable to any console where the
[K8s command-line tool (`kubectl`)](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/install-kubectl/)
is installed and configured.


# Create a Cluster

To create a GKE cluster, you may follow tutorials such as
[this](https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/docs/how-to/creating-a-cluster) or
[this](https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/docs/quickstart).
Alternatively, you may run the following steps:

1. Goto [K8s Engine page](https://console.cloud.google.com/projectselector/kubernetes?_ga=2.101714888.-830640031.1571682936).
2. Select a project, or create one if you already do not have one.
3. On the top-right, click on the `Activate Cloud Shell [>_]` button, and
__keep this shell open as all the following commands are executed in this window__.
4. Run the following commands in the opened shell:
    1. Configure project name:
        ```
        $ gcloud config set project <PROJECT NAME>
        ```
        Replace `<PROJECT_NAME>` with your selected project name.

    2. Configure zone (e.g., us-central1-a):

        ```
        $ gcloud config set compute/zone <ZONE>
        ```

        Replace `<ZONE>` with your zone preference; you may get a list of
        available zones using the following command:

        ```
        $ gcloud compute zones list
        ```

    3. Create cluster:

        ```
        $ gcloud container clusters create <CLUSTER_NAME> --cluster-version=1.13.7-gke.24 --num-nodes=1 --machine-type=n1-standard-32
        ```

        The specific arguments are:

        - Replace `<CLUSTER_NAME>` with your name preference.

        - `cluster-version`: the instructions on this page are tested using
        `--cluster-version=1.13.7-gke.24` for their compatibility
        (with `helm`, discussed later on this page).

        - `num-nodes`: the instructions on this page are compatible with a
        single-node cluster (i.e., `--num-nodes=1`). A multi-node
        cluster setup requires additional steps discussed in the following,
        __if you increment the number of nodes, make sure these configuration
        are implemented__.

        **Multi-node cluster**: The cluster's default `storageClass` (which is
        usually supports `ReadWriteOnce` access mode) will be used. If you
        set-up a cluster with multiple nodes, a `storageClass` that supports
        `ReadWriteMany` access mode should be available on the cluster, and
        should be set using `--set presistence.storageClass=[storageClassName]`
        (leaving `accessMode=ReadWriteMany`). We recommend using the
        [NFS-Provisioner](https://github.com/helm/charts/tree/master/stable/nfs-server-provisioner)
        for a multi-node setup.

        - `machine-type`: the default machine type (i.e., `n1-standard-1`) can be considered
        suboptimal for Galaxy requirements, hence we set the machine type to `n1-standard-32`
        in this example. You may choose a machine type that serves best your requirements and
        zone selection. You may obtain a list of available machine type using the following
        command:

            ```
            $ gcloud compute machine-types list
            ```

        You may refer to [this page](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/gcloud/reference/container/clusters/create)
        for a complete list of the `gcloud` command arguments.

# Install Helm

[Helm](https://helm.sh) is a K8s package manager, which is composed of two
components: client ([_helm_](https://helm.sh/docs/install/)) and
server ([_tiller_](https://helm.sh/docs/glossary/#tiller)).

In order to deploy a Galaxy instance on a K8s cluster, a `helm` and `tiller`
installations on the cluster are required. You may already have `helm` and `tiller`
installed on the cluster; you may run the following command to ensure they are
properly installed:

```
$ helm version
```

If the output is as the following, you would need to configure `tiller`:

```
Client: &version.Version{SemVer:"v2.14.1", GitCommit:"5270352a09c7e8b6e8c9593002a73535276507c0", GitTreeState:"clean"}
Error: could not find tiller
```

In order to install `helm` and `tiller`, run the following commands
in the [_Cloud shell_](https://cloud.google.com/shell/):


```
$ wget https://storage.googleapis.com/kubernetes-helm/helm-v2.14.1-linux-amd64.tar.gz
$ tar zxfv helm-v2.14.1-linux-amd64.tar.gz
$ sudo cp linux-amd64/helm /usr/local/bin/helm
$ kubectl create clusterrolebinding user-admin-binding --clusterrole=cluster-admin --user=$(gcloud config get-value account)
$ kubectl create serviceaccount tiller --namespace kube-system
$ kubectl create clusterrolebinding tiller-admin-binding --clusterrole=cluster-admin --serviceaccount=kube-system:tiller
$ helm init --service-account=tiller
$ helm repo update
$ rm helm-v2.14.1-linux-amd64.tar.gz
$ rm -r linux-amd64/
```

You may re-run the following command to ensure Helm client and server successful installation:

```
$ helm version
Client: &version.Version{SemVer:"v2.14.1", GitCommit:"5270352a09c7e8b6e8c9593002a73535276507c0", GitTreeState:"clean"}
Server: &version.Version{SemVer:"v2.14.1", GitCommit:"5270352a09c7e8b6e8c9593002a73535276507c0", GitTreeState:"clean"}
```

Additionally, you may run the following command to ensure a `tiller`
[pod](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/pods/pod/) is running:

```
$ kubectl -n kube-system get pods
NAME                                READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
tiller-deploy-6d65d78679-xr9f4      1/1     Running   0          3m17s
```

If the helm `tiller` pod is not running, you may re-install it using the
following commands:

```
$ helm reset
$ kubectl create clusterrolebinding user-admin-binding --clusterrole=cluster-admin --user=$(gcloud config get-value account)
$ kubectl create serviceaccount tiller --namespace kube-system
$ kubectl create clusterrolebinding tiller-admin-binding --clusterrole=cluster-admin --serviceaccount=kube-system:tiller
$ helm init --service-account=tiller
$ helm update
```


# Deploy Galaxy on the Cluster

The deployment of Galaxy on a K8s cluster consists of two steps discussed as it follows.

1. [Optional] Deploy the [CernVM File System (CVMFS)](https://cernvm.cern.ch/portal/filesystem)
service using [CVMFS-CSI chart](https://github.com/CloudVE/galaxy-cvmfs-csi-chart).
You may run the following commands for this deployment: 

    ```
    $ git clone https://github.com/CloudVE/galaxy-cvmfs-csi-chart.git
    $ helm install galaxy-cvmfs-csi-chart/galaxy-cvmfs-csi/ --namespace=cvmfs --name=gxy-cvmfs
    ```

    If you get an error saying `Error: no available release name found`,
    you may take the following steps:

    - first [reset `helm`](https://helm.sh/docs/helm/#helm-reset), then
    re-run the aforementioned `helm install` command.

    - if resetting `helm` does not resolve the error, you may run the following commands:
    ```
    $ kubectl create serviceaccount --namespace kube-system tiller
    $ kubectl create clusterrolebinding tiller-cluster-rule --clusterrole=cluster-admin --serviceaccount=kube-system:tiller
    $ kubectl patch deploy --namespace kube-system tiller-deploy -p '{"spec":{"template":{"spec":{"serviceAccount":"tiller"}}}}'
    ```

2. Deploy Galaxy helm chart using the following commands:

    ```
    $ git clone https://github.com/galaxyproject/galaxy-helm.git
    $ cd galaxy-helm/galaxy
    $ helm dependency update
    $ helm install . --set persistence.accessMode=ReadWriteOnce --set service.type=LoadBalancer --set service.port=80 --set ingress.enabled=false -f values-cvmfs.yaml --name gxy --namespace gxy-namespace
    $ kubectl config set-context --current --namespace=gxy-namespace
    ```

    At this point, wait for about 8 minutes, and then check the status of the pods
    if all are scheduled and running using the following command:

    ```
    $ kubectl get pods
    NAME                              READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
    gxy-galaxy-job-685ddbbf4b-7n8cx   1/1     Running   0          9m
    gxy-galaxy-postgres-0             1/1     Running   0          9m
    gxy-galaxy-web-555db6bcfb-2gwkh   1/1     Running   2          9m
    ```

# Access Galaxy

The deployed Galaxy can be accessed after the load balancer is ready,
which may take few minutes to be ready. The load balancer status can be
checked using the following command:

```
$ kubectl get svc gxy-galaxy
NAME         TYPE           CLUSTER-IP     EXTERNAL-IP     PORT(S)        AGE
gxy-galaxy   LoadBalancer   10.43.245.53   104.198.225.7   80:30597/TCP   15m
```

The deployed Galaxy instance can be accessed from the following address:

```
http://<EXTERNAL-IP>:80
```

The `EXTERNAL-IP` address can be obtained from the output of the previous command.
For instance, the deployed Galaxy instance of this tutorial is accessible from the
following IP address:

```
http://104.198.225.7:80
```

# Delete Resources and GKE cluster
1. You may `uninstall` the Galaxy helm chart release using the following command:

    ```
    $ helm del --purge my-gxy
    ```

    If you also deployed the CVMFS-CSI Chart, you may also delete that release:

    ```
    $ helm del --purge gxy-cvmfs
    ```

2. If the `reclaimPolicy` of PVCs is `delete`, all resources deployed will be
deleted with the exception of the `Postgres` data PVC and Volume.
If you wish to delete this volume as well, use:

    ```
    kubectl --namespace mynamespace get pvc
    kubectl delete pvc data-my-gxy-galaxy-postgres-0 --namespace mynamespace
    ```

3. Delete cluster: 

    You can delete the cluster either through the GKE dahsboard, or by using the
    following command:

    ```
    gcloud container clusters delete [CLUSTER_NAME]
    ```

    More info on deleting a GKE cluster can be found at the [GKE docs](https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/docs/how-to/deleting-a-cluster).
