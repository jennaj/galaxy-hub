Working for the [Galaxy team](/src/galaxy-team/index.md) provides a rare opportunity to perform research and develop software at the leading edge of life sciences, genomics, data-intensive computing, and big data analytics.

We develop [Galaxy](http://galaxyproject.org), a free, open-source platform that (a) enables researchers to store, analyze, visualize and share genomic data and analyses, and (b) provides genomic tool developers with the ability to deploy their tools within a complete analysis framework.  Galaxy is well known with [thousands of researchers worldwide](/src/galaxy-project/statistics/index.md) using it on a daily basis. Our [team members](/src/galaxy-team/index.md) are well regarded and widely recognized within the biomedical research.  With genomics being the pivot of future life sciences and healthcare, joining the Galaxy project will open an immense array of possibilities.

Positions are currently available at

* [Genomic Medicine Institute](http://www.lerner.ccf.org/gmi/) , [Cleveland Clinic Lerner Research Institute](https://www.lerner.ccf.org/) in Cleveland, Ohio in the Blankenberg Lab
* [Johns Hopkins University](http://www.johnshopkins.edu/) in Baltimore, Maryland in the [Taylor Lab](http://taylorlab.org/)

## Postdoctoral Scholars

### [At Cleveland Clinic](http://www.lerner.ccf.org/jobs/postdoctoral/#760)

[<img src="/src/images/logos/cleveland-clinic.svg" class="float-right" alt="Postdoc positions at Cleveland Clinic Lerner Research Institute" width="200" />](http://www.lerner.ccf.org/jobs/postdoctoral/#760)

The [Blankenberg](/src/people/dan/index.md) Lab in the [Genomic Medicine Institute](http://www.lerner.ccf.org/gmi/) at the [Cleveland Clinic Lerner Research Institute](https://www.lerner.ccf.org/) has several [Postdoctoral Fellowships](http://www.lerner.ccf.org/jobs/postdoctoral/#760) available. We utilize high-throughput omics technologies, such as next generation sequencing, and data-intensive computing to explore biomedical research questions. The PI is a founding member of the Galaxy Project (https://galaxyproject.org), a platform that is used throughout the world for large-scale data analysis.

Both wet lab and computational positions are available and opportunities for crossover exist. Candidates will be highly motivated, ambitious, enthusiastic, and be able to work independently and in a collaborative environment.

Applicants must have experience in computational biology, bioinformatics, or experimental genomics. Preference will be given to those with previous experience in metagenomics or microbiome research. A strong publication record is required. Candidates with well-developed research plans will be considered particularly favorably.

Exceptional applicants should send a letter of application, curriculum vitae, statement of research interests, and complete contact information for 3 professional references to [Dr. Daniel Blankenberg](/src/people/dan/index.md) (blanked2@ccf.org).


### [At Johns Hopkins University](http://taylorlab.org/joining/postdocs/)

[<img src="/src/images/logos/JohnsHopkins.png" class="float-right" alt="Postdoc openings at Johns Hopkins University" width="160" />](http://taylorlab.org/joining/postdocs/)

We are recruiting [postdoctoral scholars](http://taylorlab.org/joining/postdocs/) with expertise in Bioinformatics and Computational Biology. Our work on Galaxy is driven by our biological and biomedical research programs, and we are interested in hearing from potential postdocs with a wide variety of research interests:

* The Galaxy project, which builds software and infrastructure to make computational biology accessible to experimentalists. Research foci include both the development of analysis and data management tools, and the development of novel user interfaces and interactive visualizations for analyzing large-scale data.
* Genomics and Epigenomic mechanisms of Gene regulation, the role of transcription factors and chromatin structure in global gene expression, development, and differentiation. We are particularly interested in the role of 3D genome organization in gene regulation and integration of sequencing and imaging approaches.
* Transcriptomics, particularly resolving full-length transcripts and understanding regulation of isoform usage.
* Vertebrate comparative and functional genomics, particularly through the development of novel machine learning, data mining, and data integration methods incorporating genomic sequence and experimental data.
* Distributed and high-performance computing for data intensive science, specifically genomics.

## Software Engineers

### [At Johns Hopkins University](http://taylorlab.org/joining/sw/)

[<img src="/src/images/logos/JohnsHopkins.png" class="float-right" alt="Postdoc openings at Johns Hopkins University" width="160" />](http://taylorlab.org/joining/sw/)

We have a wide variety of active projects. Current areas of expertise sought include:

* **Distributed computing and systems programming.** We are engaged in the development of workflow systems, cloud computing based solutions, and other projects involving high performance and data intensive computing.
* **Web-based visualization and visual analytics.** We are building novel interactive visualizations of large genomic datasets that leverage cutting edge Web technologies.
* **Informatics and data analysis and integration.**  We build and use tools to analyze large datasets generated by high-throughput DNA sequencing to understand genomes and genome function.
* **Bioinformatics application areas** such as re-sequencing, *de novo* assembly, metagenomics, transcriptome analysis and epigenetics.

Regardless of your areas of expertise we seek talented, self-motivated individuals to join [our team](/src/galaxy-team/index.md). Galaxy is developed in an academic research environment, and members of the Galaxy team work closely with biomedical researchers on projects at the leading edge of data-intensive biology.

Galaxy is written in Python, but also makes substantial use of JavaScript, Canvas, and other modern Web technologies. Many of the analysis components of Galaxy are performance critical and are implemented in C and other languages as well.
